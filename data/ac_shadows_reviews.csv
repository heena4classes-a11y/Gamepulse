Sure, I can see some of the problems—like in-app purchases in a full-price game—but mostly, the things that are lame are entirely optional and don't get in the way. This game is extremely well-made. I like the systems that all work together to make a product that I would say is no less than the sum of its parts. Everything has its imperfections, but it's pretty close to ideal. Beautiful, beautiful game, infinite choices to make, never gets tOo easy or too hard, and it does feel like there's a sense of progression throughout the game, despite being a little grindy for materials sometimes (but that's what gold is for, and you can come across it occasionally in-game!). I also still wish that there was a jump button. Most of the time, parkour is what I'm going for, but sometimes I just want to have a little more freedom with the movement. This is something that has been the case in every AC game I have played, though, so I have come to expect it. Overall, I would rate this pretty high on the scale.

Start of the game was much stronger, the introductions, the generic plot etc., but once you’re given that freedom it all falls apart…it feels too big, parkour is almost entirely properly limited to castles, other areas it’s mostly running,
Japan is beautiful, but gameplay wise, with combat and atory it all falls short (just play Ghost of Tsushima).

76561198323663306,"I was enjoying Assassin’s Creed Shadows at first, even though it has a lot of performance problems. I’m running an RTX 5090 and still struggle to reach 60 frames per second. It’s ridiculous — I can play Red Dead Redemption 2 at 4K with 120 FPS, but this game barely manages 30–50 FPS at the same resolution.

Like most Ubisoft titles, it’s a massive map filled with repetitive tasks and endless collectibles that have little to no impact on the actual gameplay. For the first 10 hours, I was enjoying it, but after that, it feels like I’m doing exactly the same thing over and over again. I’m just pushing through to complete it, but without any real enjoyment. This has become a recurring pattern in Assassin’s Creed games — each entry gets bigger, but not better.

For reference, I platinumed Assassin’s Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla on my PlayStation account, so I’ve given this series plenty of time and patience. But I don’t see myself continuing to play Shadows, because it simply isn’t fun anymore.

Then, after losing internet access for about 4-5 days, I discovered that I couldn’t even launch the game. The Ubisoft Connect launcher refuses to open it without connecting to Ubisoft’s servers — even for the single-player campaign.

This means I cannot access a product I paid for, which from a consumer standpoint is ridiculous. It’s a shame that these companies bury the experience under DRM and force online checks for single-player content that should be playable offline and doesn’t affect anyone else.

76561198044035139,"i regret buying this, for a few reasons.

the game forces you to play a certain playstyle for the first time ever, naoe absolutely sucks in combat (unless you are in the endgame) but is great in stealth, yasuke is a beast in combat but horrible at stealth and movement, yasuke cant even unlock fast travel lookouts, because he can't climb long enough.

they could have just made Naoe the only protagonist with being a samurai and assassin at once, but no. they had to do push this dual protag nonsense that no one asked for.

i have no interest in playing further, the story, the missions, they are so boring that the entire game feels like im just playing it, but i dont like it, the prologue was great, the missions for Naoe were great, then everything else just.. fell to the classic ubisoft quality since odyssey.

the combat is horrible too, especially with Naoe, yeah i get it, she isnt supposed to be in combat, but on multiple occassions you HAVE to be in combat with Naoe, and that is so jank, so unbeliavably repetitive and jank, its like ghost of tsushima without all the polish and variety, its so barebones, so boring.

the only good thing i can say for this, is that this was the last ubisoft game ill ever buy, i won't be fooled again.

the voice acting is horrible, the facial animations are even worse, honestly this game feels like it was made without a human touch sometimes.

TLDR: boring, unpolished, don't buy.

Shadows is a gorgeous game with fluid parkour animation without clipping, but it is fundamentally confused about its own mythology from the very start. Our supposed new Assassin, Naoe, jas the Hidden Blade just like that but acting in the story  as if she's never heard of the Brotherhood or its tenets. 
It's an utterly baffling narrative decision; she's building some rogue league detached from centuries of established lore and driven purely by personal vengeance. 

Worse, after slogging through eighty hours of Animus data, there is virtually zero connection to the Order/Templars, the Hidden Ones/Assassins, or the precursor Isu civilization. The narrative itself takes an absolute age to get moving.  It took me thirty hours before I've met Diego ( a second PC). Thank goodness the mandatory dual-protagonist setup clearly favors Naoe, offering the true stealth the series demands. Her fluid shinobi approach to infiltration and refined kills is the superior, most satisfying gameplay loop. The other bloke's mandated ""trainwreck everything"" style is tiresome and repetitive, making him feel like an obligatory distraction.

The game presents us with two protagonists: Naoe, a nimble shinobi who is supposedly a master of stealth, and Yasuke, a powerful samurai who is a master of getting stuck on low-hanging lanterns. The idea is to switch between them for tactical advantage. In reality, you switch to Naoe to perform the one successful stealth takedown of the mission before immediately being spotted by a guard with supersonic hearing three villages away. This forces you to switch back to Yasuke, who handles combat with the elegance of a runaway ox cart. His heavy attacks have such a long wind-up time that you could file your taxes and make a cup of tea before the blade actually connects with anything.

Stealth, the very foundation of the ""Assassin"" name, has been interpreted in a fascinating new way. Here, ""stealth"" means crouching behind a paper-thin shoji screen while a guard stares directly at your silhouette, his detection meter filling up with agonizing slowness as he presumably tries to remember if that talking shadow was part of the original decor. The enemy AI seems to operate on two settings: (1) The situational awareness of a decorative rock, and (2) An all-seeing psychic hivemind that knows you just thought about stealing a rice ball from across the map.

And the world! It's beautiful, no doubt. The cherry blossoms are immaculate. But it feels less like a living world and more like an exquisitely designed checklist.

Liberate 37 identical bamboo forests? Check.

Collect 150 lost samurai haikus that all complain about the weather? Check.

Synchronize from the top of a pagoda only to perform a Leap of Faith into a pile of hay that inexplicably breaks your fall from 200 feet? A resounding, tradition-honoring check.

My journey was filled with memorable moments. There was the time my horse developed a sudden passion for architecture and decided to merge permanently with a teahouse roof. Or the climactic duel where my target simply forgot how to fight and stood there, T-posing his dominance over me until I put him out of his misery.

Assassin's Creed Shadows isn't a game; it's a cry for help hidden inside a beautiful travel brochure for Japan.

This is the first game I've ever player where I had to fight the atrocious topology, exploring is such a pain because so much of the open world is dense foliage and steep hills, I really feel like you're just supposed to let your horse auto-navigate everywhere and at that point why bother having an open world?

I kinda like that your primary abilities are divided between two separate characters with opposite play-styles, even if switching between them is a pain. The skill trees felt motivating enough but I don't think that anything could convince me that AC needed a level system, and I've hated it since Syndicate.

I don't think any of the characters really appealed to me in any particular way and the English voice acting was really spotty on several supporting characters, which is something I don't usually notice but it stuck out this time.

I generally hate rolled loot and this game was no exception, I'm not even sure as to why it is in the game in the first place since legendary gear is so abundant but I did enjoy the modular weapon cosmetics customization.

I only played the base-game and I found it to be surprisingly barren of cool supernatural stuff aside from a single ghost in one quest-line and an underwhelming DBD crossover. Why pick old japan if you're afraid to even touch yõkai? Like at least give me a woman in the mountains with several suspicious statues or a beaked turtle with a receding hairline.

This game suffers from stability issues and at times makes performing simple actions difficult or impossible, for instance I couldn't sprint for the first 20 hours of my playthrough because I rebound the controls but still had ability 2 on r1+r2 and I guess the game didn't like there being too many buttons bound to r1.

I learned about the game through controversies. Yes, the same ones about ""ewwww Ubisoft is lgbt-washing this series again, somehow the samurai is black, japanese ninja is ugly (lmao, has anyone even seen Naoe?) etc, etc"".

However, my heart really craved a game like that (probably since the last game I played with the stealthy shinobi feel was Aragami 2) - that ninja/shinobi gameplay * this big of a scale + great animations, so I said to myself: ""Hey, Rakash, let's just try it out! In the end, it doen't force me to play as Yasuke, you will just check it out and refund it if it's bad!""

LITTLE DID I KNOW

When I actually played the game, I found compelling story, good written characters (yes, their tropes are still ""revenge!"", but you can only have so much original stories...), suprisingly good gameplay that would let me play as a shinobi / sneaky ninja - Naoe is great for that path, and the game even had close to no Yasuke gameplay in first region (due to him being not unlocked yet).

160 hours later I can tell you this: I really liked Yasuke. Yes, Ubisoft added a black character where original japanese character would suffice, but Yasuke JUST WORKS SO WELL! He has a good backstory, understandable motivations, he doesn't just pop up out of nowhere to say ""yo I will be the samurai!"", but rather becomes one purely by chance.

So I warmed up to him bit by bit, up to the point of playing him almost as much as Naoe.

PLUS this game is technically one of the best products on the market. It just runs so well - no glitches, no lags, stable framerate, good flow of gameplay, nothing will stop you from playing it on the technical siede - unlike, let's say, Helldivers 2, Stalker 2 or Cyberpunk.

The missions can feel a little repetitive, so the reviews aren't wrong there but if you're just looking for a game to relax and feel cool in. This is it.",True,0,0,0.5,0,1760079264,1760079264
76561198045936510,"Honestly, while Ghost of Tsushima may have a bit more of the authentic samurai atmosphere and immersion in Sengoku-era Japan, Assassin's Creed: Shadows' story has immersed me -- and impacted me -- to a much greater degree. The prologue alone had me feeling genuine emotions that I wasn't really expecting from an Assassin's Creed game, particularly regarding Naoe's story. Without spoiling anything, there's real narrative weight in her intro and emotional development that caught me off guard. 

The dual protagonist approach does indeed work remarkably well. Naoe's storyline is incredibly compelling, weaving personal loss with themes of honor, rememberance, and resistance in a way that feels earned. Yasuke's storyline is quite strong, as well. It's authentic to the time period, a little over-the-top in some ways -- but still grounded -- while bringing a fresh and interesting viewpoint to the setting.

I don't really want to wade into the culture war nonsense, but if any of those controversies have stopped you from enjoying this game or led you to downrate it -- you're doing yourself a disservice. Judge it on its actual merits: strong writing, two fully-realized protagonists, and period-authentic stories that complement each other beautifully.",True,0,0,0.5,1,1760078364,1760078364
76561197970731370,"Recommended, but with reservations. First off I feel like I'm in the movie inception. At one point you are in a memory (the animus - a completely useless plot construct we are just stuck with now I guess) where the character has a memory during meditation where she learns how to mediate and has another memory. I literally broke out laughing.

I don't hate the story, but I have started to just spam the space bar because I'm tired of watching a movie. Some movie aspect, okay fine. A lot of movie time ... I'm starting to get bored and I just want to play a game.

Every long running TV series will eventually have a musical episode to cater to the ego of creators and it seems for games the equivalent is that every long running game series will eventually have a 3.5 hour movie embedded inside of it.

Second. Playing as a samurai is terrible. It's not fun in the slightest. I can't even be bothered to remember the poor guy's name. I put the difficulty on story mode and just wade through that part to get it over with. There is nothing fun about the combat as a samurai at all. He's a lumbering tank and even if one enjoys lumbering tanks, the combat options and the 'strategy' are so limited, it's just not fun.

So, ya, I'm having fun playing as Naoe. She's skilled, but fragile so you have to play carefully, run away a lot, and use stealth and I can see it's going to take quite a while to finish it so I feel like I'm getting my money's worth, but I really hate the samurai game play and the movie aspect, is just too much.

Among the recent AC titles, this one's easily one of the top contenders for me. The story clocks in at a solid 7/10; it's engaging without being overly groundbreaking, but the narrative pacing keeps you hooked through the twists of feudal Japan.
Graphically, it's a jaw dropper, breathtaking vistas, intricate details in every shrine and village, and dynamic weather that makes the world feel alive and immersive. The stealth mechanics are the deepest in the series yet, blending classic AC tension with innovative tools like smoke bombs and disguises, while those revamped executions, brutal, cinematic, and oh so satisfying, nail the signature assassin flair. Combat is a thrill ride: visceral swordplay that's challenging yet fair, with parry timings and combo chains that reward skill and keep fights feeling fresh and intense. And that feudal Japan vibe? Pure magic, the cherry blossoms, misty mountains, and cultural depth create an atmosphere I can't get enough of, from rooftop parkour across tiled roofs to seamless blending into crowds.
Exploration is a standout, with hidden tombs, dynamic events, and a massive open world packed with side activities that easily stretch playtime beyond 150 hours without feeling bloated. Switching between protagonists Naoe and Yasuke adds killer variety, her agile shinobi runs versus his tanky samurai charges let you tackle missions your way, and building out your personal hideout is a fresh, addictive layer of progression no other AC has nailed like this.

76561198128539058,"🌸 Assassin’s Creed Shadows – A Masterpiece of Feudal Japan 🇯🇵⚔️

Ubisoft has truly outdone itself with Assassin’s Creed Shadows. This game is everything longtime fans and newcomers have been waiting for — a perfect blend of stealth, open-world exploration, and cinematic storytelling set in the breathtaking era of Feudal Japan.

From the very first mission, the dual protagonist system between Naoe and Yasuke feels fresh and exciting. Naoe’s stealth mechanics capture the spirit of the classic Assassin’s Creed titles, while Yasuke’s brute strength and samurai combat bring a bold new layer of gameplay depth. The contrast between the two creates endless possibilities for how you approach every encounter.

Visually, the game is stunning. The dynamic weather, cherry blossom forests, and authentic Japanese villages make every frame feel like a piece of art. The soundtrack perfectly complements the atmosphere — calm and haunting one moment, intense and powerful the next.

Ubisoft nailed the historical detail and cultural respect. From the architecture to the weapon design, it’s clear this world was built with care and authenticity. And the story? Emotional, mature, and filled with moments that genuinely hit hard.

Whether you’re a longtime Assassin’s Creed fan or just looking for an unforgettable adventure, Shadows is one of the best games in the series. It’s not just another entry — it’s a rebirth of what makes Assassin’s Creed so special.

76561197994544499,"Constant issues with Ubisoft Connect prevent the game from starting up most of the time. I have successfully gotten it to start twice, but the vast majority of time it simply fails to launch due to communication issues between Ubisoft Connect and Steam.

Why is it trying to communicate with Ubisoft Connect in the first place?  I bought the game on Steam for a reason; I don't want to have to deal with Ubisoft's bloated, failed effort at creating a storefront. Yet they crammed it in like they always do and right now it's literally breaking the game for me due to how low-quality it is.

EDIT: I am still having this problem, but constant reboots allow the game to start up occasionally. As frustrating as this issue is I can't hold it against the rest of the game.

Since I'm able to reach the actual game sometimes, I suppose I should actually review it.  It's great, if a bit by-the-numbers; it's not the game's fault that Ghost of Tsushima came out relatively recently and feels almost identical, but it's a reality that the setting has been done to death.

Still, this is an Ubisoft open-world collectathon.  You know what you're getting from it.  Its production values are high and if you want an open-world collectathon set in Japan, this is about as good as Ghost of Tsushima, so flip a coin between the two or play both if you're really desperate for more.

Just...  be warned that like all Ubisoft games it's locked behind Ubisoft Connect, which is an awful, useless, bloated terrible piece of software that makes my blood boil with loathing towards Ubisoft as a company every time I'm forced to interact with its wretchedness. Usually I wouldn't focus so much of my review on it but given that its terribleness is actively making it difficult for me to start the game there's not much else to say.",True,0,0,0.5,0,1759943418,1760113452

I had just updated to win 11 from 10 and updated all my drivers. It turns out I was having problems in other games too, I just didn't realize it until I spent some time in them. Turns out the latest nvidia drivers are responsible for all of my problems. I found a link for the 525.75 hotfix drivers that were released at the same as game (on reddit, the official nvidia gam ready driver download page only went back to 57x). booted to safe mode, used DDU to completely remove the 581 drivers then installed the 527.75 drivers and the version of the nvidia app that was bundled with it. edited the registry to make sure windows wouldn't try to autoupdate the drivers and rebooted to normal mode. let the nvidia app update (just the app, not the drivers). confirmed from ""my rig"" that the 525.75 drivers were loaded. redownloaded the game and set everything to medium and 1440p. hit 120 fps sustained in the benchmark. tweaked settings (3080 ti) and ended up with almost everything on high except rtx (low). character model, particles, terrain and fog on on ultra high, kept draw distance and vegetation at high. 90 fps almost rock solid in game with and fsr frame gen enabled (this was almost a requirement to get me over 60 fps on any decent level of detail). dlss native dlaa upscaling.

Played 6 hours today didn't see a single hiccup or frame drop. 
I'll change my review to recommended but it took way too much effort on my part and the response from steam was discouraging to say the least. 


ORIGINAL BAD REVIEW:
This game could be amazing, but it crashes constantly so I can't tell. Steam itself is at least partially responsible for this bad review, and they won't issue a refund because of play time. That say I played for 8 hours, yet 4 of that was troubleshooting and trying to get it to actually finish a benchmark run instead of crashing halfway through. I played for barely 2 uninterrupted hours but had to restart, reload, and re-do the same mission like 6 times because it kept crashing. I've tried to request a refund again with those details, but it looks like I might be stuck with an unplayable game and no recourse.",True,0,0,0.5,0,1759938904,1760277094

The man-baby crying hate mob is going to clown-emoji the hell out of me for this take, but this game is one of the prime examples of why you cant always listen to modern outrage. Its a trend to just bandwagon on hate. Is it perfect? No. Is it repetitive at times? Yes. Its an assassin's creed game. No one complained about the old games where ALL fights could be won by holding the counter button. And even THEN, i enjoyed it. This games fight loop is about patterns and reactions. Missing them or becoming too cocky will result in a humbling ass kicking. 

I enjoy it a lot WHEN IT WORKS. A few times, the camera would become incooperative. The counter attacks rely on a glowing spark that only appears when the enemy is in your vision. If you get stuck against a wall, the camera may make that impossible. Additionally, not all functions always work when they should. I've found myself trying to escape after an assassination, end ended up dying because my character chose to press herself against the wall instead of climb it. A bit of jank to this game. 

Ive always wanted a Japanese assassin's creed and so far, im really enjoying it. My main complaint is the traveling.  But other than that, Its the most fun I've had since origins. I recommend playing the JP dub. Hilarious the number of people bxtching about authenticity and playing the English dub in the first place.

76561198409080217,"so far im leaving this review at two hours but will change it if my opinion changes. My first major issue is NEEDING the game to be on an SSD for the cutscenes to be able to play. There should be no reason my OFFLINE GAME buffers every two seconds in cutscenes when i can play games like rivals and cyberpunk on a mechanical just fine. 

now lets move onto the actual gameplay. the movement is shoddy at best, my computer can barely run medium graphics settings when i could play Valhalla on Ultra. there should be no reason this game is that much more of a load on my system than the one that came out like two years prior. I dont like being forced to go through three separate combat tutorials, as well as the super boring needing to walk places that could've just been a cutscene. I was really excited for this game, specifically because of the very realistic black samurai lore that could've been made, but the whole story is just bland as hell. truly upsetting

Edit: as I have played more i noticed a few things. For starters they really enjoy time jumping, no idea why we cant play good ol chronological order but maybe thats just me. the combat is very different from any ac game, enemies hit a lot harder, have a lot more armor, and the bigger enemies attack more like dark souls enemies with decently delayed attacks.  you're a lot weaker, both health/defense and strength wise, and the enemies can hit you even in dodging. i did a whole flip and got 180 quickscoped by some npc. i dont think im gonna be changing my review but i paid money for this game so i'll see it through. i get we dont want remakes but the feeling i got from AC 3 & 4 is not the same i feeling from the last few games. plus i bought something in the credit shop with the free creds and it didnt tell me i NEEDED the dlc in order to use it so im salty about that.",False,3,1,0.482030302286148071,0,1759772071,1759796146

Wasn't sure at first about 2 playable characters, but they lend to each other very well, with two very different main strengths.  The story as told for both characters is lovely and really you feel a good bond to your characters and indeed other main story characters you also meet.    I ended up re-watching the 47 Ronin because of this game, i'm that enthused.  Anyway.. digress = off.    This game has recreated japan during a particularly point in history for your characters and the world crafting is simply beautiful, with a soundtrack that you just want to play louder.

I've played AC Valhalla - boring as hell (beautiful vistas though); Odyssey was great but incredibly long winded, and Origins was a lot of fun, and AC Mirage felt like the beginnings of a good game but a very generic story - almost as if the dev team were 'learning their feet' so to speak. This game has something that none of those other games have. You ACTUALLY feel like an assassin; a trained killer. For the first half of the game, you feel like a quick and nimble shinobi-no-mono and that's exactly what an assassin's creed game needs to feel like.

76561198067578340,"this is a game that i've tried to come back to on and off for many months now and no matter how much i try, i just get bored with it fairly quickly.

i've enjoyed and played all assassin's creeds up to origin and finished them all, and try out odyssey, and valhalla and now shadows. 

this game has a solid start for the first 10+ hours when it's on act 1 and it's focused on a linear path for story telling, it feels nice and actually like a competent game, the problem occurs when you finish act 1 and it opens up with act 2 where you can now switch between naoe and yusuke, the game just falls apart. it's a shame because like everyone else has said, the world is beautiful, but ubisoft ruins it by not knowing what to fill it up with. it's a lifeless bland world where i sigh anytime i even think about wanting to open the map. and while the world itself is beautiful, traversing it is not. exploring the world just for everything to look the same after you've seen a few locations is disappointing and nothing stands out that's memorable or a place you want to go visit again.

it's unfortunate, this is the one time i bought a ubi game on a whim, let alone a AC on day one and i just can't help but sigh and feel like this is one purchase i truly regret. 

if you're on the fence, just get the game on sale when it's like $10 or do the ubi+ method where you can play it for an entire month for like $10+, that's a better approach to playing this game then paying full price or even a discount on this game unless you can get it for extreme discount.",False,8,0,0.565959334373474121,0,1759721410,1759721410

Will Update review if issue is ever fixed.

I have spent more time trying to troubleshoot a issue then playing the game itself. My NVME SSD randomly going from an average 2-5% usage to locking up the game at 100%. There are several threads online with pc gamers trying to solve this issue and even Ubisoft reps posting ""workarounds"" that at best solve the issue temporary and at worse is proof they have no real intentions on fixing this issue.

This game ironically has the chance to turn around the bad faith in the community for Ubisoft but apparently they rather sell us more cut content as DLC even after dozens if not hundreds of reports logged about an issue like this that breaks the player experience. Greed is one thing, Greed and incompetence from the business end of a company is something much harder to ignore.

I've played Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla, and I can say that this game is improved in terms of graphics, gameplay and especially combat, but it failed to deliver a consistent and satisfying story. I feel that the game lacks soul; it tries so hard to connect the woke tropes of diversity, equity and inclusion with the Buddhist tropes of suffering, compassion and enlightenment, that it ends up feeling more like a lecture than a lived experience. Instead of letting the Japanese themes emerge naturally through the characters and world, the narrative constantly reminds you of its woke western moral intentions. This breaks immersion and weakens what could have been a deeply personal journey. The problem is made worse by the cutscenes, which are stiff and awkward, with poor motion capture and lifeless facial expressions that strip away any emotional weight. Even in immersion mode, the voice acting feels flat and disconnected. The characters often act as mouthpieces for ideas rather than as believable people shaped by their circumstances. Beneath all of this, you can sense the potential for something, but it gets buried under a plainly bad storytelling; maybe if the narrative was linear it could be slightly better. It’s a real pity, because the artists and environment designers have done a phenomenal job crafting an immersive, living Japan that begs to be explored, yet the narrative fails to make that world feel alive. It’s as if the writers completely let down the incredible work of the visual and design teams, leaving players with a breathtaking setting that deserves a far better story to match its beauty.",False,3,1,0.447986990213394165,0,1759680016,1759779565

The game looks amazing visually, with impressive graphics and beautiful detail. Unfortunately, that’s where the praise ends. The game feels badly optimized and needs serious tuning from the developers. The open world doesn’t feel truly open, and the story is a complete mess — this is not how you write a coherent game narrative.

Gameplay mechanics feel heavy and sluggish. Naoe is by far the most fun and fluid character to play, while Yasuke feels completely out of place in the setting. Overall, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a beautiful disappointment — great visuals, but poor execution.

So 1st heres the BAD BUGS i found and HOW TO FIX THEM!

Bug#1- CONTROLLER DISCONNECTING  during Gameplay and switching to keyboard and mouse!

FIX-  Goto the ""GAMEPLAY"" Tab and change input to HYBRID! [It did this 3 times to me in 50 hours]

Bug#2-STUTTERING!!!! Ya i found a FIX!

FIX 1-If your using an XBOX SERIES CONTROLLER... UPDATE IT! i hadnt updated mine in probably 6 months dont know why it matters but when i updated it FIXED THE STUTTERING COMPLETELY! 

FIX 2- IF you have AVOWED installed! and its still stuttering... uninstall AVOWED! again this worked instantly! Long Story but these were the 2 causes i found!

NOW! After playing mostly Bug Free for around 40 hours minus the random controller disconnect roughly after 10-15 hours... 3 times in total... ANNOYING! But didnt really ruin the game...

I enjoyed the gameplay with the newer stealth mechanics, while the story was only ok. Act 1 and Act 3 is where the best parts are which is good except for the majority of the game being Act 2 which was boring and long. 

Overall I enjoyed gameplay especially the stealth where it is vastly improved over Valhalla's system. The new prone and shadows mechanic makes stealth more engaging and fun, although it's a shame that they didn't add social stealth into the game. Combat is around the same as the other rpgs with minimal changes to it. Parkour is the part of the gameplay where I'm most let down on as there's still no depth to it. You are still using the same system from the other rpg's. 

Storywise AC Shadows does start with a interesting ACT 1 which hooked me until ACT 2. The devs opted to use a open target board where you choose which target to go after, this in turn makes the characters unable to grow as each target can be taken out at anytime in the story. ACT 3 and the Epilogue does pick up the pace once more and gets interesting but I feel like the ending is underwhelming and only serves to set up the dlc. Voice acting is also one of the thing I think the game fails to deliver as the English VA is worse this time around, I opted for the Immersive Mode which has Japanese and Portuguese VA which was way better.",True,0,0,0.469946026802062988,0,1759455452,1759455452

I played for another hour or so without problems, so I though I had ""fixed"" the problem. Then my PC crashed again. Mind you, the game is crashing my entire PC, it's not just the game itself crashing. So I contacted Steam to get a refund seeing as though the game is basically unplayable. I was then informed that I had exceeded the 2 hour limit to qualify for a refund...wow. So now I'm out $45. Because I'm a good little consumerist sucker, I decided to try to play the game, knowing my PC would restart every couple hours or so (which it did, probably not good for my PC). 16 hours of mental anguish later, my PC has crashed at least 7 times. I'm now stuck at a cut scene that crashes my PC every time. Who knows, maybe I'll be in the mood for some more abuse from Ubisoft and give the cut scene another go... Just absolutely pathetic, what big studios expect their customers to put up with. Does anyone even release finished games anymore?

76561198859444753,"Assassins creed shadows is 7/10(Good), it does a lot of things right and fumble on some aspects.

Story: The story is pretty great for the most part. I think Naoe and Yasuke are interesting characters to follow the story in most cases, however I would definitely say naoe is canonically the main character as I find her more fitted in terms of how the story unfolds. Yasuke isnt that bad, I think he fits well in about 2-3 main areas of the game depending on the task like Omi for example. The end of the main game was bad in my opinion and a bit anti-climatic because of how the main bad guy gets defeated, I was hoping for more. The DLC definitely completes the overall plot and is handle better. This assassins creed feels more grounded compare to all the others because spoiler alert no ancient artifact or people are involved. The assassins arent really present either, although I get why people may dislike that the story does explain this and technically they are present in the dlc kind of.

Gameplay: Its just any assassins creed game to me in my opinion of course inspiration from old and newer titles. I think the combat could be refined more, sometimes i would attack accidentally instead of assassinating an enemy or attack an enemy I'm not even targeting. When the combat works it feels ok, one thing I love is the nuance of how you can trigger certain feats you unlock in mastery. The parkour is pretty cool I think better than the recent titles not much i really have to say there. The hid in the shadows mechanic is usable for both characters, but obviously naoe makes better use of it. The side quest and missions were hit or miss, I dont like the kill specific enemy type personally.

World/Atmosphere: This game really bring japan to life the culture, people, and events makes me feel like I'm experiencing the past first hand of course with the fictional exaggeration of being a ninja and what assassins creed is about. As beautiful as Japan is no landmarks or cities, really pop out partially because I'm not familiar with the history, however the landscapes were amazing and the dynamic weather and seasons. The Awaiji area is my favorite in terms of how the story affects the environment and I wish the main area did more of that.

Characters: I already typed a bit about Naoe and Yasuke if I'm to be honest they arent my favorite characters in the series. There backstories are interesting, but I dont feel attached to them, eh I may lean towards naoe more. To address a controversy of the game it does feel like Yasuke is a side character, I think it would help if Ubisoft structure some missions better. For example during most quests and missions you get the option to play yasuke or naoe, I think this plays against them because it feels like the character you are not playing as is just there to be there or out of no where. These characters should be portrayed as working as a team as you move from region to region. I think they should follow the structure of assassins creed syndicate quests and missions. The people you recruit play a small role to the main story except maybe one which is fine. I wish there couldve been something special involving them helping you in the end of the main story. The kid jinjiro is meh, but hes more involved than the people you recruit thats diabolical. 

Conclusion: I think this game is alright despite my criticisms. I would consider this more of an assasins creed game than valhalla. Shadows does the culture/atmosphere well, a few hiccups in the story department but ended pretty strong(including the DLC), and combat could be refined. Its a game I think people should try despite what the internet and certain groups who disapproves of it may say.",True,0,0,0.495340585708618164,0,1759437466,1759437466

76561198055374450,"Busywork, the video game. I have a lot of hours in AC titles in the past, and have loved them, but I am having the hardest time getting through this one. It's just open map, select marker, run to marker, do repetitive boring activity. There's barely any game in my video game.

Not to mention I spend most my time waiting for the UI to load after the map opens, or in dialogue/shop UI, because the game is so poorly optimised. No other AC has been this bad with such issues. Audio desyncing in cutscenes, character animations being so poor they're on par with early 2000s games, the camera getting stuck on every little object in combat (with no occlusion?).

It has some positives. A gorgeous world, lots to learn about the era/region, a decent combat system. But after a while, you see the same copy-pasted assets, the same copy-pasted enemies, the same copy-pasted gameplay. It's just so uninspired and sloppy. The game 100+ gigabytes, yet it feels so hollow. 

Ubisoft does not do well with characters and story, and that would be OK, if they didn't feel like they had to include it in every aspect of their games. Stop trying to make the characters likeable when the story shoves them to the side to focus on these mysterious organisations you know nothing about. I will say, I really enjoyed Yasuke's flashback scenes, the only time I found myself actually paying attention to what people were saying/doing in the game. But then they write dialogue as if you know these characters and are their best friends. Why am I calling Tomiko family after having two sentences worth of dialogue with her? It's bizarre.

There was no creative direction, or goal in mind for the development. It was just ""the same stuff we've done before, but Japanese flavoured!"". Not to mention the whole 'two characters' system, which is so badly handled. The UI for managing them both is slow and unwieldy. The world is designed for them both to explore it, yet switching between them has a loading screen??? When the rift sections let you switch between them seamlessly??? It makes no sense. I'm a (very) simple person, I buy games because I want to play games, but Ubisoft seem to have forgotten the game part of the development process, and just want your money.

76561197995004507,"Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a real treat. It introduces several new aspects that set it apart from previous entries in the franchise and instead of breaking the formula, these changes breathe fresh air into it.

One of the biggest highlights is the dual-protagonist system. You can play as Naoe, the stealthy assassin who embodies the traditional spirit of the Brotherhood, or as Yasuke, the powerful samurai who charges head-on into battle. This contrast not only adds variety to the gameplay but also creates a refreshing balance between subtle infiltration and raw strength.

Another clever change lies in the open-world design. Traveling through Japan isn’t just a matter of sprinting across open fields. The game embraces the country’s natural geography, its mountains, hills, and winding paths, forcing you to navigate carefully rather than taking straight shortcuts. It feels authentic and immersive, making exploration both challenging and rewarding.

I was personally struck by how beautifully Japan is represented. From iconic castles and the serene Nara region to bamboo forests, shrines, and other cultural landmarks, the world is crafted with incredible attention to detail. It even reminded me of my own travels in Japan, which made the experience feel even more special.

The addition of safehouses and an upgradeable hideout adds another layer of engagement. Being able to fast-travel, customize your base, and expand it over time gives a sense of progression outside the main story. On top of that, random roadside events enrich exploration, often revealing small pieces of regional history and lore while making horseback travel far more enjoyable.

All in all, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a great sequel and a bold step forward for the series. It combines familiar elements with fresh mechanics in a way that feels natural and exciting. Whether you’re a long-time fan or new to the franchise, this is a journey through Feudal Japan that you won’t want to miss.

Note: This review is based on 50 hours of gameplay. The main storyline and DLC have not yet been completed, so this opinion may be updated in the future.

[h1]Overall Impression[/h1]
Assassin's Creed Shadows leaves you with mixed feelings. On one hand, the game is impressive with its incredible technical and visual execution. On the other, it suffers from design decisions that prevent you from fully enjoying its world. The plot seems quite interesting, but my engagement with it was severely hampered by the Asian setting; the abundance of unfamiliar names for characters and cities makes it extremely difficult to keep track of the narrative, which breaks the immersion.

[h2]Pros[/h2]
[list]
[*][b]Visuals and Atmosphere.[/b] This is the game's greatest strength. The graphics are magnificent and perfectly convey the mood through weather. The day/night cycle, fog, dawn, rain, and snow are all implemented at the highest level. With headphones, the sound effects, especially the rain, create a stunning atmosphere.
[*][b]Animations.[/b] The character movements, especially parkour, look gorgeous. Jumping, climbing, dodging, and hiding are all a pleasure. Everything is very smooth and responsive.
[*][b]Enjoyable Stealth.[/b] The stealth mechanics don't aim for realism, but they are perfectly balanced. It's a casual yet engaging stealth system that doesn't get boring even after dozens of hours. Clearing out castles while hiding in the bushes is a relaxing and interesting activity, despite the occasional stupidity of the enemies.
[*][b]Progression and Mechanics.[/b] The game features several interesting systems:
[b]- Character Progression:[/b] Balanced and intuitive, without unnecessary elements, although experience gain can feel quite slow.
[b]- Spy Network:[/b] An interesting mechanic that makes exploring the world and completing missions more engaging.
[b]- Camp Development:[/b] The system is interesting, although it requires grinding for resources. However, the grind itself doesn't feel boring as it's organically woven into the enjoyable gameplay loop.
[*][b]Combat System.[/b] Responsive and pleasant. While the variety of weapons isn't really felt in practice (for example, I only used the katana), the combat is still enjoyable.
[/list]


[h2]Cons[/h2]
[list]
[*][b]The Two-Protagonist System.[/b] For me, this is a huge drawback. Playing as Yasuke is completely uninteresting. In a world where assassins are supposed to be light and agile, he feels slow, clumsy, and completely out of place—a true ""Donkey Kong among Assassins."" The need to constantly switch to, level up, and complete activities with a character I don't enjoy is very frustrating.
[*][b]World Monotony.[/b] Despite the beautiful graphics, the cities and castles look like they were assembled from the same set of building blocks. They lack unique features, are not memorable, and quickly start to feel identical. Yes, their internal layouts are different, but their external appearance is almost indistinguishable. Only the natural landscapes stand out.
[*][b]Artificial Padding.[/b] The world is overfilled with activities: question marks, outposts, towers. There are far too many of them, and due to the general lack of variety in the locations, clearing the map quickly becomes a chore. This point is ambiguous: on one hand, it's a negative because the content is artificially stretched. On the other hand, the process of clearing castles remains interesting thanks to the good stealth mechanics. But the sheer quantity is clearly excessive.
[/list]

[h2]What I Would Suggest to the Developers[/h2]
The game's main problem is its gigantic but empty world. I would advise making it three or even four times smaller. The freed-up resources should be directed toward creating truly unique and memorable locations. Every castle, every city should have its own ""gimmicks"" and features that would require the player to use different tactics and approaches. Quality over quantity.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
Assassin's Creed Shadows is a game with a fantastic presentation and an enjoyable gameplay core, but it is let down by questionable decisions in its world design and narrative. Its visuals and mechanics can provide a lot of fun, but be prepared to put up with monotony and, possibly, a main character you dislike.",True,2,0,0.5,2,1759402858,1759402987

I didn't buy Shadow at launch because Ass creed Mirage was a such disgraceful scam, having trust issue + all the woke rumors with Yusuke etc.  Well as it turns out, Shadow is a masterpiece.  And if you really wanna a quality single player game packed with content and depth, stay away from tiktok & youtube reviewers, these places are where low IQ virigins hanging out.   

Now review on gameplay, Why this Shadow is a master piece and the best Creed? 

1. The first AC in a long time actually overhauled 80% of its parkour & combat animation, that alone is a game changer, it feel like a true AC revamp compare to all ACs came before it

2. Extremely high production value paid off (pace is still too slow) High quality cut scene, good story, gorgeous graphic, great dialog.  (highly recommend turning on immersion mode where all characters speak in their native tone)

3. Great skill progression system, so far 3.5 hours in, it's all Naoe's story and skill tree and I really don't feel like I missed Susuke lol!

4. Lots and lots content with unique quests and discoverable (did take a page from Ghost of Thushima) this time around it truly feels like an ass creed game that built from the ground up.

I disliked Mirage, it felt so boring that I could only get to about 25% of the progression before uninstalling it. There was no level of reeling me into the story to get me hooked. 
Anyhow, back to Shadows, so it's another AC game with the plot mostly about revenge, helping others and recruiting a team and assassinating persons of interest. The map is massive and I'm still chipping away at discovering every little mark on the map. Maybe I'm just a sucker for feeling immersed in old Japan but I gotta say, I'm loving the atmosphere and the graphics are incredible! I admire the feeling of seasonal change in the game to keep things feeling refreshed and immersive. About every couple hours, the season changes and the surrounding vegetation and tree coloring changes. You get bright summers, to monsoon raining, autumn leaves changing and snow. There's not too much wildlife when you venture off the main roads and you cannot kill any animals which is a little lame. It seemed like all other AC games, you could kill animals, get the skins to increase your hardware capacity but meh. 
I do like the feel of Naoe, she's nimble, agile and you feel like a ninja with her. I don't like playing as Yasuke, he's a towering Juggernaut so he's mostly just a heavy hitting tank that can use large melee, rifles and bows. He doesn't jump well and not ninja like so whatever play style you want, that's your options.

Not only that, but there are a ton of skill trees and whatnot, so it's very fun to experiment with the various skills. Naoe has many useful skills for stealth while Yasuke has some insane moves for combat. Overall, both are very fun.

I also really liked the story, even though it drags on a bit towards the end. Both Naoe and Yasuke's stories are full of meaning and great messages. Plus it helps that both characters have excellent voice acting. I played in Japanese, by the way. It also helps that the story is accompanied by a wonderful score. Ubisoft also put in a lot of attention to detail here. The world is beautiful, and Japanese buildings and sculptures are full of details. It's really easy to immerse yourself in this game.

This is one of the rare assassin's creed games that I have actually put anyone time and effort in, the previous entries have all been pretty much the same. In the past I usually pay above and beyond and put in about 5 hours or less. Something always feels missing, but Shadows managed to keep me hooked on longer and I actually feel I want to progress the story. If I will complete it will be another question down the road but so far this has been quite entertaining. The world itself feels much better and tighter, the atmosphere just has a certain charm, the people and environment go on in their own daily lives and just makes it more real and engaging to be part of the world. I think I will give this game more time but it just depends if it still keeps me hooked in the next few days. 

However, they need to change up the recipe big time as I don't see me buying another one like this of its the same material, I have got all of them creeds, black flag, Origins, odyssey etc and pretty much all of them i give up on as it just does not interest me after a while, dont get me wrong I greatly appreciate all the effort it takes to make these games, especially looking at the sheer beauty of the environments, music, character arc, the worlds provided so i am and never will knock it based on that but it needs to change to something modern or totally different such as less based on history but innovation.

76561198086512574,"I love this game. I can't recommend it. Here is why; (minor spoilers ahead)

[h3]The Story is Trash.[/h3] 

It just is. It's told in an annoyingly messy way that Ubisoft is known for. It's fractured and told through flashbacks. God forbid we just experience a story as it happens. The two protagonists have ZERO reason to work together. They try to equate Naoe striking back at a genocidal warlord to Yasuke carrying out said genocide. In cultural context Oda Nobunaga is really just the more efficient warlord. Feudal Japan was a terribly bloody time for Japan. Innocents were murdered all the time by the ""honorable"" samurai. However, Naoe is given a much more modern sense of honor and justice as it mainly refers to her family. It makes no sense that she would agree that she is just as murderous as Yasuke. I don’t care if some kid gives her a lecture. The kid is wrong and childish as he should be… but Naoe is a full grown woman. It’s so bad.

The antagonists vary in interest. Some of them are pretty fun quests, some of them are boring and drawn out unnecessarily long. The small amount of good in this game's story cannot make up for the mountain of bad. If you play this, do so with the canon option because your choices do not matter in this game. I recommend immersive settings for audio because I do not think the english voice acting is very good. The Japanese and Portuguese voice acting is excellent and impactful.

[h3]Exploration is Trash.[/h3]

It’s the Ubisoft curse of having a handful of things to do (clear out outposts, pray at shrines, find scrolls, do meditation quicktimes) over and over and over again. They aren’t done in an interesting way. There are no parkour puzzles, it’s just climbing onto a roof, grabbing an item and that’s it.

The world is beautiful and feels like a real feudal Japan which is to its benefit and detriment. Everything is way too samey. There are a few villages that look different enough to sort of stand out, but I struggle to remember the majority of the villages. There could have been so much more done to make these locations interesting. There is a severe lack of interaction with the locations. There are safe houses and vendors. That is it if it isn’t tied to a quest. I do like the safe house system though.

[h3]The Stealth is Amazing[/h3]

The reason I love this game is Naoe’s gameplay. Playing on the highest difficulties and taking time on infiltrating locations is addictive. I know this is not going to be a good selling point, but as a huge Tenchu and general stealth game fan, I love doing it over and over again. It’s so rare we get a technical stealth game anymore. We have light detection, sound detection, memorizing guard patterns, using tools of distraction, and being able to hide bodies. It’s all there. It is done well and I will continue to replay this game because of it. But this is like taking a starving person to a nice restaurant and saying they can order everything. I want it so bad and there are no other options so I stuff myself here. God I wish there was a good story and interesting world surrounding it.

[h3]Combat is Okay[/h3]

Again, another Ubisoft curse is making some pretty decent combat but making enemies damage sponges that just become a chore to fight. The combat is not deep or interesting enough to make the long and arduous combat encounters worth it. Unless you play as Yasuke who is basically the opposite problem. He just melts his way through everything and is boring to play. It’s obvious Naoe’s playstyle is way more supported here. It feels like Yasuke was a last minute add in after the game had been created around stealth gameplay and to make up for it they just made the enemies take more hits. Bad game design overall.

[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]

Ubisoft has some very talented devs they do not properly utilize. I can feel the brilliance seep through while playing stealth, but the second I'm back to anything else I lose interest. If this game was more like a Tenchu game and it was level to level play, it would be an instant classic, but there is so much Ubisoft bloat and redundancy that it makes this game a chore to play. Not near as bad as Valhalla, but it’s still a serious problem. I wish I could recommend this game, and if you are like me and enjoy the stealth so much that it’s worth slogging through the Ubislop, then I could. However, for the average player that deserves an overall good game, this just ain’t it.",False,21,0,0.604287147521972656,6,1759179681,1759179811

It's a Ubisoft game and what you see is what you get. No doubt about that. I was very curious to see how Ubisoft would handle this era and don't get me wrong I was enjoying it but the only reason why I can't recommend is because of the forced performance settings it forces us to run. 

Look I have a pretty decent PC no doubt but that doesn't mean anything I want to be able to control how I want to run the game. I can imagine playing this game on the Steam Deck or any other PC handheld which is why I bought it, wanted to play on the go but after the forced raytracing is pathetic. Sorry this might be an unpopular opinion but I do not care. Games that force players to have forced raytracing and is pathetic. I had to turn on DLSS to run the game. I hate having to turn that on. Overall I'm disappointed in Ubisoft for forcing the gamers to not fully take control of the games performance.

76561199112552743,"This is my personal favorite installment since origins as I have been wanting this theme since brotherhood. The dev approach to this game has been noticeably improved, but has much room still.  What is clear is they are not phoning it in here. The new in-house graphical tech looks good, performance is mostly stable, the free content is appreciated, and the gameplay is solid, if not eventually redundant. But I even found fun in the repetition, because The art in this game is so damn beautiful. The story is serviceable with Japanese VA, but hardly profound. The team is listening to feedback and looking for ways to meaningfully improve their product while advancing the formula, and that feels refreshing. Maybe this was true in the past, but was becoming increasingly difficult to trust. Combat can be fun when mastered, and leaves space for some player expression, while there are enough options available to create a more immersive, and difficult experience which is welcome of course.  

Unfortunately, the team still fails to solve for repetitive scenarios and minimal solutions, as the current design formula again demonstrates its desperate need for complexity. The onus is once again on the player to experience the game with variety. Otherwise, it becomes very samey, as what works, always works. And of course, I still yearn for a parkour as good as or better than unity so many years later. 

7.7/10 This is a solid step in the right direction, showing that the team understands the assassin fantasy MUST stay center.

Wants:  Reintroduce the abstergo vs assassins modern day themes, and well as multiple options to manipulate NPCs (sleep, berserk, etc) - this tech in 1960s New York, 70s Berlin or Prague, or 80s Hong Kong or Moscow (focus verticality), with a priority on parkour, and more dynamic AI/NPC behavior. The way this game evolves is in movement, stealth, and npc ""intelligence"". Also, The story MUST give meaning to the level design and combat ""zones"" - NPC variety is how combat and stealth become more dynamic. 

NPC varitey can be more than just HP, equipment, skills, aggression, parry window, attributes, animation set, etc.. What changes everything is ""personalities"". A set of ""choices, and behaviors"" NPCs will make that sets them apart from others. Which will fight to the death or give in to cowardice? Which will patrol vigilantly, or abandon responsibility? Which will fight you alone, because they are that confident or immediately call for backup? Maybe some investigate more aggressively, and some are too lazy? Maybe some investigate more cunningly, laying traps, and using deception, and others more obviously. This is how combat zone methodology changes little, but experiences within them become various and alive. What if there were different combinations of intelligence (FOV, listening radius, increased strat options available and likelihood of deception), confidence (very low-very high; likelihood to engage frontal, without backup, or ignore protcol), vigilance (probability of rule-breaking), and skill level (accuracy, damage, # of ""cooldowns"", etc) for each NPC which generated a number of possible choices an NPC with a given ""personality"" will make?? an ICVS profile, if you will. Different zones, and story progression would determine the likelihood that certain ICVS types would be present in a given combat zone, shaping ones tactical approach but offering room for surprise in every scenario.

76561197992993874,"More bland than bad. I guess I had fun playing this for the time that I did, but by the time of writing this review, I find myself asking why I would continue to play it, and I don't really have an answer. I think Valhalla was a better Assassin's Creed, and Ghost of Tsushima was a better ""Assassin's Creed but in Japan"". Story-wise, I felt like Shadows vaguely echoed several themes of Ghost of Tsushima, but this only reminded me that GoT did a lot more with them.

The game having numerical levels is annoying, because if you accidentally cross a boundary you'll end up fighting enemies way over your level, though as long as you're checking your map periodically you can usually avoid this. (Sometimes there is an enemy of higher level than the area anyway, forcing you to come back to 100% it.) I would rather a game where I can explore more freely without having to look at my map all the time though.

I found combat fairly repetitive. It seems like the best strategy is to spam an ability that makes an enemy vulnerable, then do a charge-up attack to exploit it, or if no ability is available, to wait for an opportunity to do a perfect dodge to make them vulnerable and then exploit it with a charge-up attack. I just didn't see a reason to engage in most of the combat mechanics. Status effects don't really do much. Different abilities do slightly different things, but don't seem to have their own niches beyond minor differences in optimal positioning. The kusarigama has its own clear AoE niche, but the tanto and katana seem pretty interchangeable. (I didn't play Yasuke as much, who has different weapons.) Different enemy types have different attack patterns, but generally this just means I need to time my perfect dodges slightly differently, rather than significantly switch up my tactics for different foes. Unless I'm only facing chump enemies, in which case I can pull out my kusarigama and spam AoE attacks until they all die (not really less repetitive though...).

Stealth is very easy, which is not unusual for the series. It's hard for the combat-focused character, but only because he barely gets any useful stealth stuff, whereas the stealth-focused one is so well-equipped that there is little challenge for her in it.

It seems like a mistake to have one character for open combat and one character for stealth kills, or at least to delineate them so strongly in this game. Switching things up by spontaneously deciding to do a bit of open combat really helped keep things fresh in other Assassin's Creeds, and probably would've been enough to keep me playing this one for longer. In this game, you need to go through a (usually short) loading screen to switch characters, and you can't do this in a dangerous area, so you need to commit in advance to clearing a fort by stealth or by combat.",False,9,0,0.569003045558929443,0,1759085271,1759085877

The world of 16th Century Japan is by far the most impressive, expansive and immersive worlds that Ubisoft has ever made. The sheer scale of each province, the diversity of biomes from the grand pine forests of Kii to the war torn wastlelands of Harima, the quality of the world made here is excellent.

Gameplay is fun and improved from previous games, Yasuke is a tank that excels in combat, while Naoe is perfect for stealth and assassination. There is a good variety of weapons for each character which gives alot of options for different playstyles.

The weakest link BY FAR, is the story telling, and it is an absolute shame. I feel that Assassins Creed Shadows has everything it to make it a strong, emotional and captivating tale. Yasuke and Naoe are good characters, with compelling stories, that are mishandled with pacing and confusing revelations in the final act.

The story throughout it's entirety, pin-balls from the present to the past, removing any natural flow from one event to the next. This juggling of different story beats, back and forth, for the majority of the game does a disservice to alot of the emotional core of these characters. This only exacerbated by the baffling decision to write it so that characters do not find reveal CRUCIAL INFO they have known since the beginning, in flashbacks, during the final missions. This ridiculous story telling damages the plot, the characters, their reasoning, and our attachment to them.

76561198079888866,"TL;DR map too big, boring story, boring activities. Buy on heavy discount

I have mixed feelings about this one. I've enjoyed it less than origins, odyssey, valhalla or mirage, and I almost dropped it.
The core gameplay is solid and fun as usual; they even added cool assassin mechanics like crawling, grappling hook, light extinguishing with shurikens... but the rest ranges from bland to just bad.
The story is boring and low stakes. The main villain group feels like a bunch of random people who barely interact. There is no linearity at all; an ok starting sequence with too many flashbacks that feels a bit rushed, and then you simply go after the villains one by one in any order (well, except they put some regions behind arbitrary level requirements). Most of the villains have their own boring, isolated story that has nothing to do with the protag's main goals (which themselves have also little connection to the overarching assassin's creed plot). Also a few animus-related sequences towards the beginning but then nothing else. Also a boring, anti-climactic open-ended finale.
Then the map. The world is too big. Way too big. This is something that has already been said for other games like valhalla and odyssey, but somehow it felt worse in this one. 50% of the game is wasting time going from place to place unlocking fast travel. All zones feel pretty much the same and have the same activities. It's also easy to try to beeline for an objective and find yourself between steep mountain sides full of dense vegetation and have to lose a lot of time backtracking and trying to find the beaten path. This also actively decreases my enjoyment in other parts of the game: the map is so big and I have to waste so much time going places that I was half on auto-pilot and just rushing objectives, paying less attention to the beautiful graphics or some ""immersive"" features like getting clues from conversations you overhear while on a quest.
Then the activities. A million temples with some scrolls that you have to pick up. Also a million shrines where you have to pay your respects. ""Oh great, I was waiting for the 50th time where I have to wait 15s for Naoe to clap her hands in front of a copy-pasted shrine"" said no-one ever.
Then the arbitrary level restrictions. Even with Naoe and investing every last skill point and equipment slot into assassination, some enemies just have enough life to ignore it. This is specially bad in the beginning when enemies can straight up stop you from assassinating them. Boss enemies will still stop your tanto assassination until you unlock the last tanto skill in the skill tree, which btw is locked until you finish the story, so pretty useless. Also you can be roaming a lvl 30 zone and suddenly a lvl 40 enemy with a skull appears (like that pond guy, or some random lvl 40 samurai daisho on a lvl 30 castle) and you can't do anything except leave and come back a bunch of levels later.
Then the whole yasuke-naoe thing. Even if you prefer the stealth approach they force you to play yasuke at some points. Also switching between characters is a pain. Oh, you found a Kata master while playing Naoe? Well too bad, you can't talk with him, switch characters before (why bother implement auto-switching). Oh, you found one of those treasures you must collect while clearing a castle with Naoe? Well too bad, it's stuck behind a big column that can only be moved by Yasuke. Oh and you can't switch to Yasuke because it's an enemy zone.
Then the whole base building thing. Feels overengineered and useless. Building placement and decoration hardly matter since you have little reason to visit your base. Also most buildings and their upgrades require waaay too many resources. I didn't get to build many of them and barely upgraded anything past level 2 even though I was doing my best to loot and buy materials.

And many other things but the rant has been going on for too long so I'll stop here.",False,1,0,0.494111597537994385,0,1759009513,1759009513

76561197970834245,"the absolute worst part of this game is that the assassin's creed devs have settled on making most of the cutscenes out of jerky, unnatural-looking canned animations, which both look fake and lead to really painful pacing problems. there is such a clear and obvious divide between the quality of the game's witcher 3-style cutscenes, and the ones that have full motion and facial capture. naoe specifically has such characterful facial expressions when she is mocapped (even and especially subtle things like when she comes out of her house to smile at her father playing music, or steels herself before the duel in the flashback), but a vast majority of the time she is left with a dead blank face, rapidly progressing between keyframed and really uncanny emotion presets. the pacing of these non-mocapped cutscenes is really bad, all the time. even naoe's v/o's delivery of her lines is really convincing and emotional in the mocap cutscenes, but in the canned animation cutscenes she has long pauses between syllables and words like she's just reading them for the first time.

all the AC games since origins have this exact same problem, which just looks worse and worse over time, especially now that we have games like horizon forbidden west that mocapped ALL cutscenes, even fluff side quest dialog. every single character in forbidden west feels specific and alive, at least moreso than any of the characters in these much larger budget assassin's creed games. having the world and cutscenes in forbidden west planned out so well that instead of characters just saying ""go west of the fort,"" they can sometimes literally just turn around and point to where the objective is, was magical. AC shadows seems like a lot of dialog dumped on some character models with long pauses in between each line.

i really, really wish they'd pull back on the scale of these AC games in some way, with the specific goal of allowing the game to be fully motion captured. that said, mirage was scaled back but still had the same awful cutscene animation. these games want you to take them really rather seriously, and i cannot do that when i see another conveniently close shot of a face to obscure the fact that they didn't have an animation in their quiver for the thing they're supposed to be doing. i wouldn't even be mad if it was funny bad, but it's not! AC is supposed to be this mega-budget video game that makes waves when a new entry releases, but it can't do that if every character looks like an electronic marionette.

idk if this should be a yes or no review!!!!!!

one thing i do really like: holding parkour down to do a little flip off ledges. it really never gets old, except for that one flip animation that always glitches out into a different flip animation. give me one full flip please

more notes:

1. there are segments in the animus spirit world where you dynamically and instantly switch between naoe and yasuke to solve navigation and combat challenges. for some reason however, in the normal game, switching between the two requires you to open the menu, hold a button, and then sit through a loading screen before you can go play as the other character. for this reason, and that the combat doesn't feel great, i never switch to yasuke unless i am made to for a quest or activity - outside of combat, naoe is the only character who can reasonably do 90% of the normal assassin's creed activities you have to do (climbing, stealth, etc.) with any kind of fluidity or efficiency. if there was a controller binding to switch between the characters on the fly without a loading screen, which the game can literally do but just doesn't for some reason, i'd feel the decision to have two characters a lot more justified.

you can't even upgrade skills or equip new weapons/armor until you've sat through this loading screen. whenever i need to switch to yasuke, then, i also have to spend five minutes upgrading all his stuff.

2. the cutscene where yasuke gets his master's sword back and adopts his new name was really kick-*ss. exceptionally well done. i've haven't ever felt like hooting and/or hollering for an assassin's creed plot point before. i really wish yasuke had more to do than just fighting so i'd want to switch to him more often",True,0,0,0.5,0,1758991151,1760536757

I like the characters, enjoy the story and they have made some nice improvements in the overall game play of the AC Open World series. Naoe is fun to play, she's quick and fluid, the animations are cool and she really feels like a Shinobi. 

As always with AC, if you're a fan of the older single player stealth games, this one likely isn't for you. If however, you're a fan of the Open World series like Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla, etc.. then this one will likely be fun for you. So far, it's thankfully more like Origins or Odyssey then Valhalla. It doesn't feel as bloated as Valhalla and it's not quickly getting old like that one did. This game got a bad reputation and that was mostly on Ubisoft but in the end, it's a good game. If they were smart, they would release a free demo so people can actually try it and see. I picked it up on sale for $40 and it's a great deal for that price. 

it still has the stupid in game store which needs to die, the idea of paying to reveal the mini map is just insanely stupid. micro transactions in single player games is just a horrible idea. Luckily, it can all be avoided, I haven't opened the store and don't plan to, don't buy the micro Transactions please.. Ubisoft needs to stop doing this.

The storyline actually kept me engaged the whole way through, I ended up grinding pretty hard because I was so into it. I really appreciated how flexible the game is when it comes to playstyle; I was constantly swapping builds to keep things fresh and avoid getting bored.

Now that that's out of the way, there are a few things I want to mention.

I understand the Bo staff is part of the DLC, but it would’ve been so much better if there were a way to unlock it earlier in the game, rather than having to finish the entire epilogue. It’s such a great weapon, versatile posture stances and a solid variety of abilities made it one of my favorites.

The pathfinding system was also a bit frustrating at times. It would send me on wild goose chases when the objective was literally just across a river or a short climb away. Also, I think the “pathfinder on” feature should default to guiding you to the nearest road or usable route when stranded instead of just saying “no path found.” I often found myself stuck in mountains or forests at night, having to scramble through trees or up steep terrain. And before you say “just fast travel”—these were unexplored areas on the map.

Another issue I ran into was with the Teppo, Bow, and Kunai. They often felt buggy. I’d have my cursor directly on a target, but it wouldn’t turn red to indicate it was being recognized, which made aiming unreliable. Eventually, I gave up on using ranged weapons altogether and stuck with the Long Katana and Bo Staff.

Lastly, I wish there were more interactions with allies. Once you unlock them, they basically become just another ability on cooldown. It would've been amazing to storm castles or complete major missions alongside them, similar to how it worked in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.

If you haven't played an AC game in the last ten years, love Japan, and haven't played Ghost of Tsushima (which is overpriced and never goes on sale), this game will likely resonate with you.  But if you've played Odyssey, Origins, Valhalla, or Mirage, it's a lot of the same and very little new.

The game is bulky, slow, huge for the sake of being huge, and the genuine novelty of playing as a Shinobi is washed out by the clunky mechanics and fact that -- no matter how much you like the shinobi character - you have to play as a tank for a chunk of the game.

The story is boring -- boring writing, lots of on-screen dialogue, and absolutely no suspense unless you lack imagination.  The characters aren't that engaging, the flashbacks are unnecessarily jarring, and my goodness, Ubisoft loves a codex entry!  It's a bloated tired model that hasn't changed since Origins -- it's just grown.

If you can suck it up past all that, there are some good gameplay moments if you change the settings, but you have to fight through the standard kudzu of Ubisoft cutscenes, unneeded melodrama, and overly-played plot points.  It feels like UBI started with a good game, but constantly felt they had to add more crap until the crap overwhelms the novelty.",True,2,0,0.476821213960647583,0,1758780565,1758809730

76561198399035634,"[h1] TL;DR: I dislike this game and don't recommend it. [/h1] 

I don't like this game. I'm not sure what fit of nostalgia I had that made me purchase this, but it feels worse than Valhalla, which at least had its own moments. I think the characters (so far) are flat and boring. I find the sudden shifts in emotion in the SAME CONVERSATION to be baffling and whiplash inducing. To be fair, I had that same criticism for Valhalla at times and I've heard similar about Mirage, to say nothing of the goofy facial animations they use on occasion in all of the modern AC games.. 

The combat feels clunky for how I try to play. I play with a lot of deflects, and hitting the parry window still doesn't feel quite right. I don't know why. Compared to For Honor, another Ubisoft game, this one feels like every action has a slight delay between input and action. Maybe that's my hardware, but I thought at 13700KF and a 3070 would be sufficient to run Shadows on medium settings at the minimum and custom settings even higher at 1080p and 60 fps. Sometimes I can barely hit that, and sometimes it's buttery smooth up at 120 fps. 

The environments look pretty good, which has often been Ubisoft's strength. The destruction of so many parts of the environment is incredible. Seeing actual holes, fibers, splinters, and bamboo move and be destroyed and sometimes persist and not despawn the moment I looked away was awesome. The intracacies of the actual world and what all is in it is incredible, and I like that they did that. But it feels like a dead land. Compared to what I know they can put to field, there's so few people. It's shocking, but advancements always come at a cost, and I personally don't think it was a good trade.

The music is... Alright so far. I feel i haven't actually noticed it enough for it to be good or bad, and so far, whenever I have noticed it I'm just annoyed by it. Other than the rock music. Good music, terrible placement and timing. It nearly made me uninstall the game because I thought it was gonna be a running thing, but I haven't yet. And to be clear, because someone is gonna say it, yes, I know the games have had modern music before. I didn't particularly enjoy the modern stuff being in the games then either, but them using period accurate instruments alongside a future/science-y sound and having the modern day setting be somewhat more sci-fi made the strange and eerie soundtrack of the Desmond games and AC4 (I stopped caring about much of the music in the series after that) feel like it fit the tone and historical settings. I didn't usually notice the modern instruments as much, because they fit in most of the time. There was that one electric guitar in Ezio's Family that I can remember, because it was jarring but cool, and I would like more like that.

The eagle sense is closer to original AC games, but that doesn't always feel like I want it to. That's just me being finnicky and tainted in my opinion because I got used to how they did the new eagle sense in the modern games with a bird and a pulse, but now they've shifted back, sort of. I like the idea of Observe, and it is nice to use, sometimes. But I use it the most to tag enemies, through walls, but the other half of that is that I use the new Eagle vision, which kinda sucks. It sucked in Ghost of Tsushima to, until I was able to move faster, and now I like their version the best. Can't see through walls unless you're in the mode, and no tagging methods that I can remember. It was fabulous because it made me aware of my surroundings and actually learn how to track people through walls without eagle vision. It was great. Now it feels like I have to use it, and even when I do, half the time the UI won't load for 3 seconds after exiting a menu.

I wanted to like this game so bad when it was announced, so long ago. Although ""announced"" is a geneous word. We got a picture and a project name, and even then we already knew it was in development. I wanted another real AC game. I like the RPGs as RPGs, but they're not Assassin's Creed. They're interesting sometimes. I got Origins day 1 and was dissapointed it wasn't what I had wanted, but I was fine with it. I thought they were trying something new and would keep trying new and different things, but actually making it into the series it was. And then Odyssey. I skipped it, and having looked into it a bit, I would have hated that game with every fiber of my being. Valhalla was a present from a friend, and I doubt I'm every going to go back and finish the Odin stuff and all the random new garbage they keep adding to that mess of a game. Then Mirage. Mirage, is closer, but I don't like all the magic and other ridiculous things. some of the best stuff Mirage did, looks almost accidental. I never played it but watch multiple full playthroughs, and will say that I would not enjoy it.

And now I'm at Shadows.

I wanted to be early Ezio, kind bad at stuff, and growing incredibly competent over time. But, the fighting feels old now. It was old in AC4, and it was old in Revelations. It was Old in Valhalla, and it feels like a worse version of that. I wanted someone in a specific outfit, with a hidden blade, to fight Templars. Now I'm in a revenge story that I've already heard before a dozen times, and in better ways, with boring characters I don't care about, in a setting I love, in a beautiful world, I desperately want to like this game. But the more I play it, the more I hate it.

Everyone who loved this series has said it, but this isn't Assassin's Creed. It's an RPG, set in feudal Japan, and it's not even better than the other game I played with that almost was the same thing. Don't bother buying this, until it goes on sale for $10 or less. And even then, I wouldn't recommend it. Go play Ghost of Tsushima if it's the Japan part you're after or one of the old AC games if you want that kind of an experience. This is just another RPG, where you choose what kind of person your character is, from a mostly boring set of choices, that has a parry and dodge system, along with gear and levels. You've probably played better elsewhere, and to anyone who enjoys this game, power to you.

there is lot to dislike about this game, but let's first get what's good out of the way: gorgeous graphics, buttery smooth movement and better fighting and stealth mechanics.
that's it.

awful scouting and discovery system - unnecessary, illogical, brings nothing to the game - what were they thinking? the very first quest where you have to find someone - imai sokyu, you first have to send a scout to get his general location and then the game expects you to walk around town and without any other indicator, stumble into a particular house with a particular person. there are more than 200k views on videos on how to find the guy on youtube, which tells you pretty much everything you need to know about the system. turn off immersive mode as soon as possible or you will be playing this game in five years with 10% finished.

soulless world - huge but mostly empty. the game expects you to invest considerable time into exploration and discovery. it's a real pity they put this into the most boring and empty and huge assassin's creed game. you have four main types of destinations - castles, temples, kofun tombs and towns/villages. They all look similar, you can do exactly two types of things in them - assassinate and loot and it gets very monotonous very quickly.

you play two one-dimensional characters. fujibayashi naoe, japanese kunoichi - shallow vengeance story, vapid and boring, but at least offers the full gameplay freedom. 
yasuke, african samurai, is severely limited in terms of gameplay mechanics, equally boring, vapid story. 
the only fully fleshed-out character, loveable yet real, is junjiro and he honestly deserved to be in a better game.

base building - unnecessary, boring, brings nothing.

story - by far the worst part of the game and a total regression on previous games. you have a huge board with hundreds of quests which are all exactly one of two things - assassinate or loot someone/something. there are tens of characters with completely disjointed stories, you play them in a whichever, disjointed way and, naturally, you don't give a rat's posterior about any of them. 

conclusion is that i am honestly surprised at how badly this was messed up. yes, the stealth and fighting mechanics are better than most AC games, but everything else is pretty miserable apart from graphics. now, i have paid much for the game, even on discount, and i can appreciate having a pretty boring game to turn my mind off after work, so i will most likely finish it, but i do not recommend it at all.",False,2,0,0.50641024112701416,0,1758714561,1760249787

76561198025011751,"I've played the majority of AC games throughout the years, so I have a soft spot for the franchise. I waited on getting this to see what the response would be like before playing because I wasn't sure what it would truly be like. However, having played nearly 60 hours, I'm finding the game enjoyable overall. I would say give it a try if you're on the fence, but wait for a sale.

GAMEPLAY
It runs smoothly, the controls are fluid, and I like playing as an actual shinobi. These sorts of games are always going to be visually stunning, so I'm going to skip the part where I tell you how beautiful it looks. Instead, I will say that I agree with those saying it does feel a little repetitive in that a lot of the gameplay is about clearing enemy bases, searching for loot, and eliminating targets. If that's your thing, you will enjoy that aspect. I opted to play in immersion mode (with Japanese audio), so I can't say if the English voice acting is any good, but the JP voice actors are excellent. I think it's fun listening to their different dialects. Lastly, I absolutely love the new hideout building mechanic! As a fan of city-builder games, this was an amazing addition. While I can't be quite as creative as I like with placing objects, it's still a lot of fun to build out your little village.

TRAVELING
The last part is a staple of the franchise, though, so you can't count that as a negative. Japan is a mountainous country, so of course traversing the countryside can be challenging, but I haven't found it to be so terrible that it makes me want to stop playing. I've found that riding uphill on horseback overrides Naoe sliding downwards, even if it takes a little bit longer doing so. Then again, I really like exploring, so I will always take the time for sight-seeing. 

STORY
The story is a little plain for my tastes - a traditional revenge tale with a bit of mystery. It's not groundbreaking. I do wish the story had more memorable side characters, but it's not a dealbreaker for me. I personally prefer playing as Naoe, though I did end up liking Yasuke more than I initially anticipated. He is *much* more clunky to play being a samurai and all that, but he's powerful as hell. What's more, there's always something to do. The map isn't SO massive that you feel overwhelmed with all of the things you won't have time for, which I felt was the case in other titles.",True,0,0,0.5,0,1758682019,1758682019

Afterwards, there were TWO MORE where Noae was wounded and limping around. Same effect, but thankfully these didn't last too long. 

2 hours in, and I have seen the same finisher several times. 

Played as Yasuke, and he's about what you would expect from a black samurai, but hey, he bursts through doors like the Kool-Aid Man. Haven't touched that character again since being able to play with Naoe. Also, his intro story is literally ""white man bad."" Cringe.

Naoe plays well, like an ASSASSIN. She's not great in head up combat, which I think is really cool. She's also nimble and the game plays to her strengths very well. In this respect, she should have been THE character to play as, not one of two. 

Looks good, but even a polished turd still smells like shit. I gave this one a wide berth and finally picked it up to give it a whirl to either change my opinion or justify it. Honestly deserves a third option of ""maybe.""

I will probably put a few more hours into it, but I doubt I will go too much farther unless it sinks a major hook somehow. Too much hand holding and a failed attempt (yet again) at making AC a true RPG. If you do play it, put the combat and stealth on at least Expert, as this is yet another example of dogwater catering to the tiktok crowd with flashing attacks that are wildly telegraphed from enemy archetypes that number.... 3 so far. Katana guys, spear guys, bow guys. Assuming I will see one or two more that telegraph the same sad attacks ad nauseam.

76561197976649581,"An extremely polished open world stealth action game that dazzled me with its production values.  The game ran like a dream on my getting-kinda-old PC and gave me the feeling that comes along every couple years, that a game just feels like the state of the art as a complete technical and production package.

The stealth gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect from the series at this point, but it's all executed very well.  It's a formula that won't surprise anyone in 2025, but I still find sneaking into a castles with many 10's of guards, moving slowly, figuring out how to disassemble the opponent piece by piece to be some of the most purely engrossing time I can spend with a game.  There were several times that I looked at the clock and was shocked to realize that I'd spent an hour taking down a single fortress.  Shadows' big change is to allow you a second option, playing as a samurai character focused on toe-to-toe melee.  It not only changes the way taking on a fortress plays out, but completely changes the rhythm of the game, and I think both styles are better for the contrast.

I personally enjoy the ""you're in a living museum"" approach of the recent AC games, though it can be a bit dry at times.  It's interesting to come across places like a tea farm in the hills or a soy sauce brewery in a town, then look up the name and see that it's a real place.  It's mostly a visual experience; there generally isn't a lot to this stuff in terms of simulation or interaction, but the visual modeling is incredible in its own right.

The story is so self-serious that it sometimes reminded me of a period drama that might have played on PBS when I was younger.  It feels like Ubisoft is exceedingly concerned with showing respect for the history and cultures that it portrays; it's a long way from the days that the series would have you fist-fighting the pope.  I'm generally OK with that, but a bigger problem with the storytelling is the way it breaks up the steps of quest lines due, with each step at increasing levels.  By the time you get towards the end of hunting down all the members of, say, a corrupt rings of merchants, you might not remember why you started doing it in the first place because the setup happened 50 hours ago.

Playing this kind of giant tentpole game where the credits show thousands of names is starting to feel a little like seeing the last of an endangered species.

76561198036174698,"This is finally Assassin's Creed again for me.
I didn't resonate at all with the mythology trilogy - dealing with magic, gods, and sparkly weapons (although I enjoyed Origins and it has the most playtime of any AC game for me; it was a fun departure from the norm, but it shouldn't have been the fork in the road it became for future games). AC has always been, or at least intended to be, a historical study combined with a stealth game. I see a lot of reviews complaining about how this game lacks the mythology and magic elements. I'll counter by saying that if you LIKED games like Unity for the parkour, or Brotherhood for the feel, or Syndicate for the worldcrafting - you'll like Shadows. To me, Shadows is FINALLY a return to form after all these years. I wish Valhalla (dealing with my favourite historical setting) had received this treatment.

There are some new mechanics I'm clicking with very well - the map resetting bases and other things on a seasonal cycle is a genius move tailored to my preferred gameplay style. Games that involve clearing maps of strongholds (thinking of the AC games, Far Cry, etc) run dry as soon as the map is clear. Having it feel like you're pushing against the tide of time by having the bases reset (along with the map weather/design changing) with the seasons is exactly the kind of dynamic I love and I hope it makes it into future games.
The home base design is the best in AC so far - I wish we'd had this more in previous games. The UI for base design is a little clunky and clearly designed for console users. Could do with some tweaking to have all the building elements on screen at the same time as building them. But building your home in this style is amazing and looks great when you walk around it.

At time of writing, I'm not yet at the point in the game where you can play as the second character - the Samurai. I'm still playing as the shinobi-style female protagonist and she's great. I get the controversy over the Samurai character's design choices. In a game setting which intends to plunge you INTO the game world, designing the character intentionally as a fish out of water seems odd. As has been observed my many - the decisions seems purely PR designed rather than anything else. For a game which intentionally celebrates the diversity of its development team within every set of title splashes, by this decision they seem to intentionally ignore the playerbase's intention to explore each one of those different and diverse groups through choosing a game in that setting, by having one of the two playable characters not adhere to the setting they're celebrating. I'd almost have made the opposite choice myself - stick with the iconic Japanese Samurai, and have the sneakthief be of a different ethnic origin who's a fish out of water. It would match the story themes (which are finally lovely and detailed in this game) much better. 
The wiser choice for Ubisoft to ACTUALLY celebrate diversity through black representation would be to set an entire game in a setting where the main character feels integrated with the world. AC: Origins was a perfect example of this and a great game in its own right. But there are countless other opportunities to celebrate a PoC main character: India (e.g. Maratha Confederacy & British East India Company in the 18th century), the Madagascar Pirate Haven in the 17th–18th centuries, or even a New Guinea Pre-Colonial & Early Colonial Era centered on resistance to Dutch and later German colonization. There's SO much history for Ubisoft to explore and celebrate. Anyway, this topic's been done to death, and this game offers you a compromise if playing as a non-native PC is not your cup of tea.

My main qualm about this game though, actually, is how long it takes for you to actually be allowed to play. I checked my playtime once I was finally out of a string of cutscenes stitched together by walking conversations or brief linear fetch quests, and it was over an hour of the character staggering, healing for days, getting stabbed again, and getting very upset, and meeting new characters etc etc. Please one day AC, just drop me in the open world and let me begin the story when I'm ready. Other people have critcised the pacing in review too so I won't say more.

Another problem with the game being designed firmly around consoles rather than PC is the god-awful hold-to-use buttons. Almost every action, be it eagle vision, climbing on a mount, opening a chest is a press and hold to interact button now. Particularly during steath gameplay when eagle vision needs to be activated second nature - having to wait a full 2 seconds or so to activate it is very frustrating. I get the reason is for controller players to avoid mis-inputs. But for goodness sake, allow the setting to be turned off in control mapping! I actually ended up with RSI-like symptoms and an arm ache at one point from hold-pressing V for eagle vision so many times.

I won't finish on my complaints though as, as I said, this game really is a return to form thematically and gameplay-wise for Assassin's Creed. You've finally got an AC game again, not a Witcher game repainted with Assassin's Creed skins. The game world of Japan is beautiful, the character acting, particularly in cut scenes, is gorgeous (something that fell off the table since Origins), the movement is fun, and combat (when mastered) is fun and feels setting appropriate. Great job, Ubisoft, on remembering what made Assassins Creed fun in the first place.

The story is weak in my opinion. The voice acting is poor. The world lacks the artistic style of Ghosts of Tsushima and is more clean, realistic and drab. Grey skies and endless forests. Castles and towns that look the same. Muddy streets and hovels. It tires quickly.

The upgrade system is absolutely infuriating. You can't just level up and upgrade. You have to gain ""knowledge points"" and jump through hoops just to unlock rewards you've earned by all rights already. 
The balancing between the two characters is needless as well. You're either a nimble, stealthy Shinobi or an absolute tank of an Afro-Portuguese Samurai who bulldozes all in his path. I just wanted to be a normal Samurai like so many of my enemies. Some of the areas are fully off-limits to Yasuke as well so it really doesn't work.

The RPG element is wearing thin as well. The weapons are all replicas with various minute stat changes. Same for the armour and it doesn't look particularly great as well. What's the point of having a robe that's L25 vs another robe that's L40? Armour makes sense maybe because of build quality, but robes? And straw hats!? Please. It's ridiculous.

76561198058843834,"Look, its a Ubisoft game with all of the pros and cons that come with that but... it is probably the most fun I've had in an Assassin's Creed game since Black Flag.

        First off, it actually has stealth gameplay which is nice. It also has the action RPG type of gameplay from Valhalla and Odyssey for those who like it in the form of Yasuke, but the stealth gameplay is easily the best in the series. You really feel like you're sneaking around like a shinobi rather than a low visibility tank like in most of the previous games. Second, the world feels alive in a way that few of the other games in the series do. The seasonal changes and things like that (again, its a Ubisoft game so don't expect THAT much) make it feel lived in. Its also nice that it has an immersive option so the game's voice over switches between Portuguese and Japanese when appropriate. Again, this helps with the vibes of the world. Third, the story isn't awful and the voice acting plausible. Personally, those aspects ruined AC: Valhalla for me and broke immersion regularly in AC: Odyssey, but not everyone cares about that sort of thing.

        All of that said, its not a Baldur's Gate 3 or a Witcher 3 or whatever type game. If you like the older AC games I'd say its a must grab, especially on sale but its not a must play kind of game. The gameplay can get a tad repetitive and it has microtransactions up the wazoo (though not the worst AC game by that metric). While the world is quite nice aesthetically, it lacks... depth. Its the little things like that the merchants are open 24/7 or that there is no wanted system if you commit obvious crimes. While the seasonal changes are cool, they happen very, very quickly and there is little control over it. I'm barely very far in the main story and it has technically been like, 3 or 4 years based on the seasonal changes. There are also some missions that are only available at night... which you can't wait for. Another irritating thing is the number of purely cosmetic things available that aren't clearly marked as such. The hideout is kind of cool but very dead and almost everything in it is cosmetic. You CAN build a watchtower and an alarm system but its never used! You can add animals but they can't be interacted with. So many things like this are just absolutely wasted by the game... its very frustrating.

This isn’t a historical sim. It’s a stylized blend of stealth gameplay and classic Japanese samurai cinema. Think Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Harakiri—films that thrived on dramatic framing, deliberate pacing, and stark black-and-white contrast. Ubisoft didn’t just borrow aesthetics—they paid tribute to an entire visual language.
The game’s not trying to be 100% realism—it’s channeling the emotional weight and visual storytelling of vintage samurai films. If you’re expecting textbook accuracy, you missed the point. This is reverence, not a reenactment.

76561198001590452,"Now that Claws of Awaji is out, I can finally give a fair review of this game. AC Shadows was the longest wait in the franchise, and it comes with a new gameplay formula to give the series another new identity. Different players will have different opinions on what defines this franchise, but for me, as someone who's played since AC1, the RPG trilogy was a lot of fun, especially Valhalla, where I felt they got most of the mechanics right, maybe except stealth. So why am I bringing up the old games? Well, Shadows is great in the way that it has the best stealth gameplay to date, and being an agile ninja in a gorgeous setting and soundtracks also sets this AC apart. But aside from that, the rest of Shadows can feel like a step down from the RPG trilogy.

At its core, Shadows plays like an assassination sim in the vein of the Hitman franchise, and similar to AC1 where taking down targets is the bulk of the game. This is not bad, considering it's what some crazy fans asked for since the main complaint of the RPG trilogy was having too many “distractions.” But eventually, Shadows is like what happens if you take the target system from previous games (Cult of Kosmos, Order of the Ancients) and make it the only mechanic, without side activities and variety.

Even though this is a game where stealth is fun as hell and supposed to be the main focus, Yasuke being a mechanic to force combat gameplay doesn't play well for me as combat eventually becomes unenjoyable at higher levels, enemies are very spongy with no setting to tune it, and boss fights boil down to spamming combos until long health bars run out. Equipment leveling is also a chore-ish nightmare; the system feels like it's there as busywork rather than contributing to meaningful progression. Scouting with the eagle is also greatly missed here, since Shadows replaced it with a dull scout-sending system. And most of the time, the target information magically appears without direct investigation or build-up. Outside of the main targets, you'll often find yourself going straight to the target without any real lead or quest, which makes for some head-scratching story moments.

Speaking of story, Shadows goes for a more grounded narrative, which is again, what some crazy fans asked for, and while has its moments, it slowly loses engagement that can especially be felt in Claws of Awaji. The ISU storyline is completely absent, the modern story feels half-baked, and most characters suffer from “safe writing,” though I really enjoy Naoe's character. The biggest disappointment, though, is the unfinished conclusion of the story. The main game ends on a cliffhanger, and Claws of Awaji picks up from there, only to somewhat ends it on a rather weak note. On top of that, it feels like the buggiest game in the series, with memory leaks, audio loss, crashes, and too many issues to point out.

All in all, Shadows is a fun stealth game, which is why I gave a thumb up. After all, I did find it enjoyable enough to complete almost all the side quests. But coming from the RPG trilogy, it feels like a letdown. And aside from contributing improved stealth to the franchise, it also feeds into the rumor that different AC studios are seemingly trying to undermine each other's work.",True,28,7,0.589637696743011475,0,1758525903,1759396286

-Combat is fun and surprisingly active when using Naoe.
-The world is beautiful
-Better stealth mechanics
-Sweet flips n shit

The Bad
-The voice acting makes me cringe at times
-The story is bland and forgettable almost immediately
-Its still just ""climb this tower to uncover the map and take over this fortress/base""
-Yasuke feels pretty much useless compared to Naoe
-They got rid of climbing on a bunch of surfaces, so where you could have climbed over an obstacle in the past, now you have to run around it. Thats not fun. Its tedious.
-The camera inside of buildings is bad. It was clearly designed for outside use like the other games, but there are so many interiors throughout this game I'm constantly annoyed when I go indoors and its viewing angle is awful.

Buy it on sale for 50% off or more and I think its an ""ok"" purchase. $70 for this game feels like a rip off since theres absolutely nothing new or really innovative to see here. I dont think I'm ganna end up beating this one.

-Combat

I had to turn down the difficulty all the way down to Story Mode because this combat system is dreadful. For whatever reason, when you parry for the 4th time in a row on the light blue Flurry attack indicators (Also make it a different color. Don’t make a white indicator and a light blue indicator for an almost identical attack animations when I need to react differently for each), Naoe simply doesn’t block or parry. She just gets hit. Dodging sometimes doesn’t actually dodge either. Finally after about 10hrs you start getting gear that makes you feel on par with enemies rather than constantly trying to punch up. Oh! And enemies level up to your character level. This means no matter where you go you are always below or on par with enemies.

I’ll admit that this is more of a personal gripe because why bother giving the player and enemies a level based on attack and health, when the enemies are going to keep their base health and attack level on par with you? And sure the higher level regions are there to keep you from speed running to the end game content, but maybe just lock them? Like, just lock the region! Lastly, AC Valhalla allows you to toggle a feature that lets you steam-roll regions that you out match, giving real value to its power level system. I’ll come back to that.


-Parkour

Good lord it’s awful. Can’t count the number of times I would just not climb up a building with Spacebar held down or not climb down it with Ctrl held down. It sometimes doesn’t work at all, other times it will just do whatever it wants. Example: There’s an European ship off the coast of Sakai that has a synchronization point on the top of the mast. 5 min of climbing later and leap of faith jumping into the water half a dozen times, I finally made it a little over half way up the mast. I might find out later that there’s an incredible weapon on that ship I missed and I wouldn’t care. Somehow Ubisoft forgot how to make climbing up mast nets correctly, despite doing it in AC Black Flag 12 years ago and making 7 more AC games since. This is also the first time I’ve felt like there are less climbable surfaces than there are unclimbable surfaces, which is a staple of an AC game.


-Music

What the fuck is this mildly spaghetti western music they have going on in that opening prologue cutscene when [spoiler] Nagato is killed [/spoiler]. Like how do I take this moment seriously??


-Menu features

This is the one that is the most egregious. Valhalla had so many different menu settings for the game you could make the game play and feel exactly the way you wanted it to be. You could change the damage dealt, received, regen, adrenaline rate, overall health. You could change the window timing for a parry! You could even change the Time to Hold for a hold button!!! One of the greatest QoL features you can put into a game! It was incredible, and as fun as it is to rip on Ubisoft, I really think that these features in Valhalla shows real innovation within game development, and should be the new standard for games.

AC Shadows went and ripped basically all of that out. Not only did they rip it out, Ubisoft felt the need to make ⅔ of all buttons a hold button for absolutely no reason. None at all, and I can't adjust the Time to Hold length. Just let me loot a body with a simple key press, or use eagle vision, and why would I need to specifically hold spacebar [b] TO LOAD A SAVE FILE!!! [/b] A mouse button isn’t good enough to load a save file anymore, when you’re already going ask me if I’m sure I want to load a save file???!!! It’s a save file!!! Not some piece of sketchy software off the darkweb! It’s a save file!


-Conclusion

I looked some things up and found that AC Shadows was made by Ubisoft Quebec, who also made AC Syndicate and AC Odyssey. I’ve played both of those and I don’t remember being as frustrated with those two as I was Shadows. Montreal has made most of the other AC games which would explain why Valhalla is plainly better. I walked into this game really expecting it to be a lazy $45 Feudal Japan paint job over Valhalla, and I would have been thrilled with it. I truly would have been happy to handover $45 to Ubisoft for that game. But sadly it's not. Maybe I’ll come back to AC Shadows later on and like it a little better, but until then, I will be celebrating the day that Ubisoft forcibly removes this game from my library like they did The Crew.

When trying to assassinate I feel like I'm waiting an extra fraction of a second for the prompt to come up which is problematic when I'm doing something risky or need the quickest possible followup assassination. What makes it far worse is that if I press it to early I'll swing at the air, accomplish nothing and send everyone into alert. I play with a controller and creating a separate bind just for assassinate is not a nice thing for me.
More importantly if someone's detected me and I turn a corner and want to quickly assassinate someone who HASN'T detected me, the game won't let me. This creates what I feel to be an unfair hurdle in trying to regain control of a situation.

I'm not a fan of the combat. Some enemies have a few overtly subtle attack animations which are really annoying to read. sometimes there's blue indicators and then other times there's not, or you'll be rolling dark souls style when they throw four consecutive unblockables at you and you have to back off and space them. Some attacks have crazy tracking.

While we're on the topic of combat there's these big guys with clubs that have a grab attack. It's pretty easy to get out the way of, until I either teleport back into the animation or just kind of float in the air 5 metres behind them and eat the damage.

The parkour is flashy but shallow, which I don't most of the time but it can suck to be punished for the game misinterpreting your intentions, or the character just freezing and not doing what you want.

While I'm more a fan of the older AC games I can appreciate the good here but there's just too many problems.

76561198136443832,"Its pretty on par with what you expect from modern AC. The entire game plays like a cheap tech demo, mostly because of the camera motions, but I'm not even kidding, instead of making the camera convenient and ergonomic they make the camera handle exactly how it looks when you see the first gameplay reveal trailer of any new game. Instead of spending time making the camera feel as unatural as possible, they should have spent that time preventing the combat camera from being covered by obstacles or stuck in weird positions just because you locked onto an enemy. 

I don't think the non-stealth combat is nearly as good as Valhalla and other recent titles, it feels very cheap and not worth your time. I'll still probably try to finish this game solely because I like the stealth gameplay formula. It introduces some new mechanics like hiding in shallow water which I think is neat. 

The most egregious part of the game that I cannot look past is the sound design. I'll preface this by stating I played with English voices so this may not apply if you listen to it in the character's respective languages, Portuguese(sometimes) & Japanese. During the most emotional parts in the game it plays western cowboy movie style music which feels out of place almost immediately. During some dialogue in the game you can easily tell when lines had to be re-recorded, you'll notice how the voice suddenly sounds different like the VA is recording from their bathroom at home instead of a studio or home studio. Once, a character named Ise Sadatame in the main questline was sniffling and coughing throughout the whole conversation except for just one voice line where he sounded healthy again with a very noticeable shift in sound quality and voice actor mood. Lastly, my worst complaint for sound design by FAR is how often the combat music is some goofy trap beat that ruins any immersion you might've been able to experience thus far. 

AC Shadows has better animations outside of the cutscenes. Inside of cutscenes, the facial animations can't compete with 7 year old games like red dead 2.

With that game working, I tried AC Shadows again, and sure enough, Ubisoft Connect now recognized Shadows.

note: i went into it thinking it was going to be awful, because of all the online drama surrounding it, so i was very pleasantly surprised at the overall quality of the game.  i only grabbed this game because it was on sale and i was looking for something cheap and new to play.  underrated assassin's creed title, for sure.",True,0,1,0.476320832967758179,0,1758162984,1758162984

76561198114519015,"I don't usually write reviews at all, much less long ones, but I thought this game was really a waste of potential. It's one of the better games Ubi has released in a while now, I'm not gonna sit here and tell you it's ""bad"", because it isn't. And I'm not too happy giving this one a thumbs down, but I really just...don't recommend it.

tl;dr: Ubi doesn't seem to know what they're doing with this series anymore, but we all probably knew that. Game's absurdly repetitive, none of the story or characters are interesting, not worth the purchase. I held on for the expansion and AC nostalgia reasons, but just ended up disappointed.

Gameplay:
Stealth is pretty fun, when it works right, but the AI is horrible and inconsistent. When you're Naoe, the AI sometimes has Jedi-level awareness, but then they sometimes can't hear Yasuke killing all their friends and firing a gun, 15 feet away, on the other side of a paper door. Combat, I didn't enjoy at all. Ubi made some effort to try and make it varied, I could see that, but it didn't matter, because it usually boils down to mindlessly hacking away at the health bar of an enemy wearing a kosode who's spamming uninterruptible attacks and barely reacting to a sword across the chest. And, by default, most of the primary targets across the world just can't be outright assassinated because they have too many ""health segment"" things. You can turn this feature off, yes, but there are a lot of perks and gear buffs that are intended to increase the amount of segments you remove, so those all become useless. The gameplay loop itself is just the same thing over and over, with basically nothing different or unique about most of the targets. Plus, most of the assassination targets are pointless, and there are A LOT of them. Nothing changes if you kill them, and most of them aren't related to the story. It's just some loot and XP. Quantity over quality is a big problem in this game. I held out to do pretty much everything because I have that completionist OCD, but man, I need to work on that.

Story:
I'll keep this part spoiler free, and do some minor spoilers towards the bottom of the review. The game starts off pretty good, and it had me kinda hopeful for a solid revenge story with the Assassin's Creed conspiracy cloak and dagger, creepy ancient sci-fi stuff, and modern day crisis with characters learning the alternate history and secrets along with me. Well, that isn't what we got. We got a solid act 1, a completely pointless act 2 that's just hunting down some people I don't remember anything about, and an underwhelming act 3 that ends on a cliffhanger designed only to sell you the expansion if you didn't already have it. And not even a good cliffhanger. I think one of the things that really annoyed me the most, personally, was how many times there were important story beats, or stuff that could've been really interesting going forward, that were either completely glossed over, solved by the sudden appearance of annoying and sorta demonic looking children who took over the scene, or characters just not acting like believable human beings. The terrible facial animations take you out of it pretty often too, and they're still using that weird stage animation thing they do in place of cutscenes that make everyone look like a malfunctioning robot. Which is a real shame, because the Japanese voice cast is pretty good. I still think using a real historical person (Yasuke) as a primary protagonist, in a series that has a background of keeping to some level of historical accuracy, was an odd decison. That feeling never went away. It's weird making rpg decisons about a dude's life when we don't even know much about the real guy. Of course, I guess the historical accuracy days for the series have been over for a while, so maybe that's a me problem. I held on for the expansion, since I was dumb enough to pre-order and had it anyway, but it's a whole lot of nothing. Shockingly so. And it keeps crashing to the desktop right before the final encounter, but I don't care enough to wait for a fix before I leave this review. I hate to say it, but I really can't stress enough how there is literally nothing compelling about this game in any way.

Spoilers, but minor:
[spoiler]This game has almost nothing to do with Assassin's Creed. Naoe has a hidden blade (the folding one like Connor's, so that's cool), you can get some pointed hoods, you see the crest a few times, and you kill a few Templars near the end of the game, but that's it. And the Assassins are all dead (again) because some edgy guy didn't get to sleep with Naoe's mom, so he betrayed them because he was jealous. I'm not joking. The modern day stuff is restricted to text files you can earn through some weird battle pass thing they shoehorned in, and nothing else. And there is not a single peep about the First Civilization through the entire game. Not even any Isu gear you can find. No temples, nothing. The First Civ and modern day has been a driving force in every AC game, in some capacity, since the first game, and there's nothing about either in this one. If you're like me, you've been waiting for the potential Japanese setting since back when Subject 16 was poking around from beyond the grave, and I guess this is the payoff for that wait.[/spoiler]

So yeah, I don't know. If you liked Valhalla, you might like this. It's the same bloated mess, but less buggy, and with mostly-working stealth. Before launch, I kinda already decided this would be my finale with anything new from Ubisoft if it didn't impress, and I'm still feeling pretty solid in that decision. It's not often I play a game for so long and feel like it wasted my time, but maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did. I hope you do.",False,7,2,0.527576744556427002,0,1758149974,1758149974

76561199348001633,"I have played every single AC game except AC1, Odyssey and Valhalla. Despite enjoying Origins (for reasons like storytelling, main character, hidden ones DLC and overall the majority of the map was cool to explore) this one while seemingly having less outlined RPG elements, feels more empty and soulless. Now for one, i might have been one of those kids in 2018 begging for an ancient japan shinobi related type of game, yet this is not at all what we all fantasized about. This game has a very boring storyline with a lot of characters that are uninteresting except Oda. While the world is pretty it could have been reduced by 25% or maybe even 50% and have kept every single actually important location for gameplay immersion. AC Mirage was a step in the right direction but Shadows tossed it all away. 

Now i know everyone tried their best on the project, the world is truly stunning and the technology used is impressive. But personally for me i just payed 70$ for a great stealth experience set in 16th-century Japan while playing as a shinobi. That is great, however it is still not good enough to be Assassin's Creed. At least in Syndicate both of protagonists belonged in the game. Yasuke on the other hand is useless, just feels like a three meter superhuman who breaks the game and the purpose of it too. Stealth is AC Shadow's only and pretty much undisputed achievement, then Yasuke breaks it... quite pointless. Many other issues i do not want to repeat but for anyone wondering i agree with both YT: jayvee and MasterAssassin on overall game evaluation and takeaways. 

Also playing on keyboard makes me miserable, the game is so slow to react to button input it is very annoying. Please play on controller guys, if you want to avoid being upset early.

This is one of the better games UbiSlop has released in the last years. Bear in mind, that doesn't mean it's a good game...

Gameplay:
For 40h I've been running around from one place to another where everything looks the same. You do like 3 quests on a new location, kill one of the bad guys, then run to another location for 15min to do the same thing again. The repetitiveness is crazy. The map is huge and can be pretty, but that prettiness lasts for like 10h, after that every place looks pretty much the same. 

Story and pacing:
I'll try to make it spoiler free. The game shows you Naoe that is fun to play, is agile, does flips and cool stuff, and the world feels that it's been build around Naoe. The paths, the climbing, opportunities to assassinate characters all feel stealth/Naoe oriented. I feel that Naoe was supposed to be the only playable character but they still added Yasuke at the last moment and decided that they're gonna start and finish his story in the base game, yet the one character with a really interesting story that you can enjoy, has an ending in a DLC that was released 6 months after the release of the base game...here I'm speechless...
Story revolts around the same killing system that was used in the last 4 games and I'm fine with that, but the feeling of killing every target is so underwhelming. 

Bonus:
Yasuke was supposed to be a side character with a cool additional story, Naoe was supposed to have the wholy storyline oriented around her (that way they could have added more interesting stuff to the game and not waste that much time on Yasuke's character and mechanics, just added him as a side character with a few interesting quests or even add him and his quests as a DLC where you team up with him). This is not a AAA game, it cannot compete even with many of UbiSlops older games. I appriciate the effort to make a game set in a feudal Japan, the location is great, but the map is just way too big for an AC game. 
Please just give us more linear game, with less RPG mechanics like looking for loot and equipment, give us equipment through story quests, give us more meaningful and more refined quests, storytelling with soul, with an effect that will stay in our heads for years like you used to do with AC2, BH, AC4BF, even Origins had a really good story.

76561198039550885,"Verdict: A confident return to form. Shadows pairs striking visuals with smooth performance and a well-paced, dual-protagonist narrative that meaningfully changes how you play. It’s one of the series’ most engaging entries in years.

Graphics: Environments are a standout - densely detailed towns, serene countryside, and atmospheric interiors. Materials, foliage, and nighttime lighting look excellent; character models are expressive and well animated. Art direction favors clarity over clutter, making stealth readable without sacrificing beauty.

Performance: On current-gen hardware the game runs consistently with fast loads and minimal streaming hitches. PC settings are robust and make it easy to dial in a stable frame rate. I experienced no show-stopping issues - just occasional texture pop-in in fast traversal.

Story: The alternating perspectives of Naoe (stealth-driven shinobi) and Yasuke (honor-bound samurai) provide a grounded, human lens on political upheaval. Their arcs intersect smartly, and side quests add texture rather than padding. The pacing ramps up after the opening hours and sticks the landing.

Gameplay & Systems: The two-protagonist structure isn’t a gimmick - it unlocks genuinely different approaches. With Naoe, missions reward patience, routes, and tool usage; with Yasuke, timing, reach, and stance control shine. Level design supports both paths, and swapping playstyles keeps the loop fresh. Traversal is fluid, stealth feedback is clear, and combat reads cleanly even in crowded skirmishes.

Bottom line: Assassin’s Creed Shadows looks great, runs well, tells a compelling story, and its two-hero design delivers meaningful mechanical variety. Highly recommended.",True,0,1,0.5,0,1758129064,1758129064

Origins was my favourite of the new style of games while I probably enjoyed the ACII trilogy of games the best after the original. ACII took the series in a way I wasn't hoping based on the original game but it was still fun. The changes that Origins took the series in are different but also still quite good. 

I enjoy Shadows for what it is, despite the douchey marketing and dudebro/nerd combo of 'GIVING US WHAT WE WANT EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE IT!', with subsequent patches and updates to the game. The fact that you couldn't change the time of day from morning to evening unlike every game since Origins was enough to almost make me leave a negative review because this game still has missions that are based on time of day. I can manually force a seasonal shift but not a day/night cycle.. please. 
[This is referring to a horrible 'state of the game' video - life is better if you avoid these]

My only gripe with the game worth mentioning is that in a mode that is meant to be about 'immersion', because it's literally called 'Immersive Mode', is that Yasuke still talks in Japanese to Portuguese characters despite them sharing a language, and at times there will be two Portuguese characters talking in Japanese, so.. maybe broken.. but 'duuuuude.... brooooo... it's ruining my immersion'!

Also it would be better if 'Canon Mode' actually structured the main story-line and progression through the world rather than just made decisions from the dialogue tree.. you can still jump all over the world doing all sorts of things in all sorts of orders and the story suffers because of it. I chose the mode that is the way the story was meant to be.. I'm completely fine with you saying you can't go to Kii and do those side missions until the main characters have a reason to even be in that part of the world.

Looking forward to getting to the expansion/dlc story, but I still haven't completed the main quest yet - been taking the game region by region. Beautiful world even on my crappy ol' PC with a 1070.

[Edit 26/09] Okay, I take it back with speaking of the Portugese 😁 at least with the way that Ubisoft implemented it..

I don't know if the game was always like this.. or if it was changed in the recent hotfix but I just did the quest [spoiler] chasing Nuno Caro: End of the Line [/spoiler] and it freaked me out because I was thinking.. what happened to Yasuke's voice and they're just using the Portugese translation with a completely different actor.. very off-putting. Come on Ubisoft.. have the Japanese voice actor read a couple of lines in Portugese - give them a voice coach or something it's not like they need to do the whole game in a second language.

It’s frustrating to be stuck swimming around moats because your character can’t scale rock walls, or circling ships with thick anchor ropes that you can’t climb.

It works as follows: Rating (Weight) is a component of overall rating. For instance, if I was to rate a game in three categories and give three ratings and corresponding weights, it would look like this: 7 (0.9), 2 (0.4) and 10 (0.6). Then, I would compute the end factor as follows: (7*0.9 + 2*0.4 + 10*0.6)/(0.9 + 0.4 + 0.6) = 6.9, which is a weighted sum. Anything above 6 would be definite Yes, anything below 4.5 would be definite No. If the game is around 5, I'd give my personal thought to whether I would recommend the game.

* Character design: great - 10 (1.0)
* Combat: average - 5 (0.9)
* Environment: great - 9 (0.8)
* Weapon/Armour: average - 6 (0.7)
* Story: good elements only at start but disappointing in general - 4 (1.0)
* Engaging and repetitiveness: average - 5 (0.9)
* Additions: not so important but Codex is one of the best extras I find in the game - 10 (0.4)
* Cost: overly overpriced for what it offers, DLC is a bit too much for the amount of content - 1 (0.9)

My final result is 6/10 and my recommendation is Yes, although £60 is IMO total overprice. Apart from scenery and great character design with some good elements all around, it's still not the best game. It's engaging at first but then it becomes slightly too much a core. It's highly overpriced.

if you can afford it, the game is entertaining, so do play the game. However, you may be disappointed, especially due to combat, story progression, and lack of variations.

Character design (10/10 - 1.0)
Characters are well designed. I like both Naoe and Yasuke. I prefer stealth over open fights so I play Naoe more but this is only a personal preference.

Combat (5/10 - 0.9)
[s]Unfortunately, when it comes to combat, AC Shadows is the one of the worst games[/s] This has improved after last update 1.1.2. It's no clunky and become quite smooth, but it's still hard to make manoeuvres because turning left/right/around make character stop (!!!) or heavily slow down. Obviously, one can adapt.
Secondly, there is no difference between light and heavy enemies and this I am afraid cannot be salvaged. The combat is EXACTLY the same whoever we fight with. It's just a matter to wait, block, and strike. Rise and repeat. Bosses are not even challenging. The fight is longer only because of a larger health pool. In 136h I dedicated to the game, I found only one optional boss, which was very challenging. In genral, this game is disappointing.

Environment design (9/10 - 0.8)
Stunning! Not only is this game placed in feudal Japan, which I enjoy playing the most, but they put huge effort to all details and the result is fantastic scenery. When it comes to music, I am not so enthusiastic. The music is good and have great impression and start, but then it's getting repeated across the game, no matter where we are. Still environment is great.

Weapons and armour (6/10 - 0.7)
Stats are not explained and it's not clear what to play with. We get lots of random weapons. I think most of them are not useful at all. Weapons and armour have engraves giving additions s.a. Bleed or Poison but it is not really clear and explained what works well given circumstances.
While we can still make decision what might be the best, I have simply been running nearly across the whole game upgrading what I picked at the beginning and really did not feel importance of changes. Probably because combat is shitty in the game so I did not have to worry about improvements.

Story (4/10 - 1.0)
it is the most important aspect of games and the story in this game is not impressive. It works great at the beginning but then it is slightly getting pushed behind.

Engaging and repetitiveness (5/10 - 0.9)
The further in the game I am the game becomes less and less engaging. At some point everything works the same, plundering and looting castles is not different in further areas.
There are contracts but re rewarding is so disappointing. Again, there is no difference between areas we get contracts in.
The game also offer some mini games s.a. weapon training Kata or Archery, as well as meditation challenges Kuji Kiri. All of them are OK apart from Kata, which is simply speaking plain stupid. I pretty much Autocomplete everyone of them.

Additions (10/10 - 0.4)
The game provides Codex we can open any time we discover new area, detail, fact about Japan, as well as animals around. We can spend time to read about plenty of historical and environmental facts as well as the culture and surroundings. So, you can learn a lot about Japan just playing the game. This is a great addition but not as important as other categories.

Cost (1/10 - 0.9)
To put it blatantly, AC Shadows is simply overpriced for what it offers. There are cheaper and much better games than this. It does not provide repetitiveness and engagement. There are no challenges, so it is simply one time purchase. Not worth it for the time being.

76561199055427584,"If it combined both protagonists (or even just removed Yasuke), it would be amazing. As it stands, there is barely any reason to use Yasuke other than bruteforce where even he will be overwhelmed.
You can just look through walls and see treasures everywhere. As such, they become less fun to find and more of a chore. The tools dont feel limited because you get them at every corner when in a castle. Sometimes you cant walk on walls for no apparent reason where you can on very similar ones. Due to knowing where everything is, you feel obliged to get everything and when you find a locked shed you are disappointed because there is something in it, or because you cant carry the materials back to your base because you cant take them for no apparent reason and only your used-up spies can.
The Graphics are great, but, as always, optimization is not quite as good.
The wanted feature just seems to exist to force the player to play the other character or go somewhere else. Just makes the game worse.
The different assassinations are fun, but arent good enough to actually change anything for. The health segment system is good, but could be better.
Enemy levels are absurd. The same exact enemy that deals a small ammount in one area ONE SHOTS in a different, somehow more difficult area. Could definitely be handled a lot better than instantly dying to a 1/7th of my health by a simple area change, way too radical. 
Though, looting castles and just exploring is fun. In castles, you do not have to directly engage with the enemies. You can slowly kill the trash enemies while the minibosses arent looking, then assassinate the miniboss who now has no backup. Once done, get a nice Legendary item with a probably useful perk. But if it comes to actual combat, it looses all fun. Yasuke just feels very slow, comparable to swinging a greatsword without the impact in other games. You cant really respond to attack since theres a very noticeable input delay, but luckily you can just hold a button and block almost everything with him, and if he does get hit he takes almost no damage. With Naoe, if you try to attack the enemy normally you will do barely any damage. You almost have to either block the enemy to create a weakspot or use an ability to do so, and then do a stronger attack to deal any damage. The exploring is also fun, with minigames and viewpoints making it somewhat enticing to try to get them all, and the scenery changing every few hours is a nice change of pace,  though i wish it could be disabled to have the ability to choose one season for the entirety of the game.
The drop in quality between cutscenes is very noticeable. Sometimes feels like the quality of good mocap, other (most) times like bad face rigging with the same expressions repeated hundreds of times.
The NPCs helping you after you help them seems very weird. Most of the game has a strict regime which would most likely punish (has punished or tried to the MCs) any dissenters, and yet the random elderly man i helped protect his crops is instantly willing to enter my service as a spy.
Story can barely if at all exist because it is so nonlinear.
Still a fundamentally good game mechanics wise, but could be worlds better with some of these changes and less ingames. It all feels very all or nothing, i.e. no stealth but combat or no combat but stealth and being oneshot or surviving with a lot of health, IMO it suffered by introducing 2 MCs.

76561199045111229,"[h1] The Open World [/h1]

Shadows has an incredibly rich world with detailed graphics and beautiful landscapes. This is something I really look for in open-world games — a well-crafted world that doesn't feel repetitive.

Shadows offers a world without patterns — no repeated terrains with the same flowers, shapes, or colors. Every corner of the map feels unique, and even similar-looking buildings don’t look the same because of how they’re placed within the world.

Whether it’s winter, summer, spring, or autumn, the world never looks the same. Everything changes — colors, flowers, falling leaves, winds, rain — everything.

To me, it’s a flawless world — and that’s both the good and the bad thing about it.
Why? Because it’s too much. It's so excessive that I would have preferred they spent a little less money on the world to give more attention to the cutscenes.

[h1] NPCs & Cutscenes [/h1]

The cutscenes are terrible. The dialogue feels childish, the animations are overly ""NPC-like"", and the characters themselves feel extremely robotic — to a point that doesn’t fit the rich environment they’ve created. I would have preferred a slightly worse world in exchange for a cinematic narrative story, even if the environmental quality dropped a bit.

There’s a disconnect between the NPCs, story, and world, and the result is an imbalance.

[h1] Story [/h1]

The story itself is decent to quite good — but the execution is awful. The childish dialogue, the overdone kindness, the uninspired ""go from A to B"" quests — they don’t confuse you, but they also don’t make you want to follow the story.

[h3] Yasuke [/h3]
[spoiler] Yasuke is a very good character — but he doesn’t fit the world. His story should’ve been sadder, darker, and should have had narration or behaviors that made me feel his emotions — but it didn’t. He’s so overly good, and the cutscenes so dry, that at some point I just stopped caring.

I was expecting him to be a slave or something like that, and the way his story started, I thought it would make me feel something — to feel sorrow or get chills. But it failed completely. The performance is very poor. [/spoiler]

[h3] Naoe [/h3]
[endgame spoiler] [spoiler] For Naoe, I was expecting much more excitement when she discovers her mother’s past — but unfortunately it happens at the end of the game. That’s not a good choice, because it leaves the character in her final emotional state without giving her room to grow based on that discovery.

It would’ve made much more sense for her to learn about her mother earlier, then start the hideout and mission with whatever organization or future DLC comes next. The game played a strong card and then closed that chapter way too dryly. Again, I insist — the bad execution made the story feel disgusting. [/spoiler]

[h1] The Organization [/h1]
[spoiler] They were all terrible. [/spoiler]

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

Yasuke = Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (which is irrelevant for an AC title)
When they gave the game early to influencers and YouTubers, they said you’d be able to stealth with Yasuke — just that it would be harder because he wouldn't have all the mechanics. That turned out to be a lie.

Yasuke cannot stealth at all. He just runs into combat like it’s a 1v30 battle with no strategy. 0/10

The only interesting gameplay is with Naoe, who actually has the stealth mechanics.

The stealth in Shadows is the best they’ve done in any Assassin’s Creed title so far.
Naoe can’t just climb almost anything in the game — she can also go pretty much anywhere invisible, as long as you do it correctly.

The stealth mechanics are balanced, and you really need to think about how to move around without being seen. You can literally play the entire game as if you were a shadow. Granted, in Nightmare mode the stealth can be a bit buggy in some areas, but not enough to make you not want to play it.

Two things I didn’t like:

Eagle Vision, which makes the game way too easy (and is also bugged — it’s super blurry at close range, so you need a mod to fix it). 

You can skip all the NPCs and just go straight to the objective without needing much strategy. You don’t even need to kill anyone — you can do most missions killing just 1–2 NPCs max

76561198257109304,"I’ve put 55 hours into Assassin’s Creed: Shadows at the time of writing this review. I was originally planning to go for a 100% completion run as I do with most AC titles, but I couldn’t bring myself to finish the story or side quests... I simply got too bored. Which is saying a LOT since I've completed every AC game and have 100% almost all of them.

At first, the game shows promise. The dual-character campaign is an interesting idea, and I enjoyed switching between Naoe’s stealth-focused style and Yasuke’s brute-force approach. Early missions and gear upgrades kept me engaged, and the Japan setting is visually stunning. Ubisoft clearly poured effort into the world design and atmosphere, and for a while, it’s easy to be drawn in. Truly, the visuals and soundtrack for AC: Shadows are gorgeous.

But the problems become impossible to ignore. The biggest issue is the level scaling system. No matter how much time you spend grinding, collecting legendary gear, or over-preparing for upcoming bosses, it doesn’t matter. Enemies and bosses automatically scale to your level, so the satisfaction of becoming stronger or mastering an area is stripped away. Progress feels pointless, and after 20 hours, the loop of grinding, gearing, and moving to the next region completely loses meaning, especially since a lot of the side quests and missions feel the same.

COMBAT
------------------
Combat is another letdown. On paper, the contrast between Yasuke’s heavy combat and Naoe’s nimble assassinations should feel dynamic. In practice, both grow repetitive fast. Enemies all share predictable patterns, bosses are nothing more than giant health bars, and increasing difficulty doesn’t make encounters more strategic or challenging, it just turns fights into tedious slogs by inflating enemy HP and slightly increasing their damage. Additionally, while I get what they were trying to go for by creating this contract of Yasuke being an unstoppable force in combat but bad at stealth and Naoe being great at stealth but bad in combat, I found it super frustrating to do any sort of combat with Naoe. At a certain point, no matter what gear, weapons or level you are with Naoe, combat with her just feels like it takes forever because you do no damage and he abilities don't feel like they do anything. While all of Naoe's attacks are flashy and look cool, I found myself just spamming her heavy attack at a certain point just to end combat quickly because of how un-fun it is to do combat with her and how little damage her attacks do. (I ended my playthrough at Lvl. 55 btw, and I STILL felt like she was doing no damage even with fully upgraded gear.)

STORY
------------------
The story suffers from pacing issues as well. The opening drags on and on with tutorials and flashbacks, the dual narratives never mesh as smoothly as promised, and the ending (from what I've seen) lacks payoff. I never felt any sense of mystery or satisfaction tracking down the main story bad guys, and since the story is so long (not in content, it just takes a long time to level up enough to be able to progress), I found myself completely forgetting what I was supposed to be doing or who I was supposed to be mad at in the story. Additionally, the side quests, which should add flavor and be enjoyable, are formulaic and repetitive. Even travel becomes a chore because horse riding is slow, sometimes it's confusing what you are and aren't allowed to climb on, and the world, while beautiful, loses it's mystery and thrill to travel through after the 5th shinobi or ronin encounter.


CONCLUSION
------------------
There are glimpses of what Shadows could have been: gorgeous visuals, a strong setting, and occasional chemistry between the protagonists. But all of that gets buried under bloated systems, repetitive combat, meaningless progression, and narrative drag.

In the end, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows feels like busywork disguised as an epic, and I found myself realizing that playing the game was almost like a chore at times. If you’re an AC completionist, you may find a few hours of enjoyment in the stealth mechanics or exploration, but for most players, this is one you should skip.

With that being said, I love Shadows but it's not perfect. 

Story-(7/10)
Act 1 and Act 3 are Amazing. They have some really powerful and emotional moments. 

Act 2 is not a story but just hunting down targets. Not bad but not memorable. 

The game barely mentions Templars but they are the most interesting villains in the game and franchise. I wish they would have done more. 

Gameplay-(10/10)
Combat is fun whether you play as Naoe or Yasuke. Being able to go prone is fun and adds a whole new layer of stealth. The same is said for the weather and season/Day and Night Cycle. 

Characters-(5/10)
Naoe, Yasuke, Junjiro, Tomiko, and Chichiue (Naoe's Father) are the only memorable characters. No one else really stands out. But the ones that stand out are well written characters.

Soundtrack-(7/10)
The game has some real bangers. 

Game Length-(8/10)
I'd say that the game is about the perfect length. If they had added more templar content then the game would probably feel perfect in length. 

Difficulty-(7/10)
I had a small learning curve but once I figured it out, the game felt easy. 

Grind-(7/10)
Grinding for resources to upgrade the hideout can be a bit of a chore but overall not bad. 

Graphics-(10/10)
The game has amazing graphics. The only other time I've only felt this immersed in a world was in Red Dead 2.

Audio-(9/10)
The audio is great. Characters felt real as did the world around you. There was the occasional audio bug but nothing bad. 

Price-(8/10)
Worth it but the industry keeps going up on prices, soon I'll have to sell my kidney. 

Bugs-(9/10)
60+ HOURS AND I ONLY ENCOUNTERED ONE BUG. I did a mission that forces a weapon on you but did not have the weapon in my inventory so the game kept crashing when I attempted the mission. 

Audience-
This is a great game for anyone who wants an open world RPG with fun combat. Whether going in guns blazing with Yasuke or being a ghost like Noae. However, if you compare every AC game to the Ezio games then you will hate it. 

Overall-(8/10)

76561198052969002,"In my opinion this game is a straight downgrade from Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Assassin's Creed Odyssey (I slept on Mirage so I have no frame on reference to that game, since it didn't seem all that interesting to me).

Splitting all equipment and abilities between Naoe and Yasuke was a mistake in my eyes, I'd much rather have one character that can use it all, like Eivor or Kassandra in previous entries.

When getting loot rewards, it feels absolutely awful when you realize that the item you got is exclusive to the character you don't plan on playing unless the game locks and forces you into playing it to progress the game (Which it has done, much to my annoyance).

I despise the Knowledge system, it is an entirely arbitrary system used to lock you from getting perks in the skill trees by forcing you to do annoying and repetitive mini ""games"" (If you can even call them that, since some just amount to: Go here, press a button, wait 10 seconds for an animation to finish, repeat two more times.) to be able to get enough Knowledge poins to unlock incrementing Knowledge tiers (Knowledge is a separate measure to experience, which just makes it even dumber in my eyes that this system exists).

Dialogue choices feel pretty meaningless and without consequence. You say X, the NPC replies with Y, and if moves onto Z, and even if you had picked A instead of X, the NPC would just say B and move onto Z anyways.

The armor and weapons you get are all pretty lackluster visually, because obviously all the interesting designs are locked behind the cash shop in this singleplayer game, you just get four or five armor models and the way they make the illusion of having more is by spamming random retextures (Many of which in my opinion are gaudy or just plain ugly). As for the weapons you get a few blades or hilts, etc. and they randomly put two together when dealing out rewards, along with some retextures of the same things.

Overall, I regret my purchase of this game, and I would refund it if I could. I really tried to enjoy it, but as it is now I definitively recommend skipping this game. Which is a shame because I am a fan of the recent AC games, especially Valhalla, with it being tied for my favouite AC game alongside Revelations.

76561199656255452,"Don't listen to the people hating just because of ubisoft. Play the game and make your own opinion please.

Pros: Graphics are insane, the map is well done and doesn't fell empty at all, sound design is top level, mechanics are well done and fresh (like the sidekick one), side activities are cool and castle are pretty good although some of them feels the same as others, seasons are a nice addition with winter being beautiful and impacted gameplay (you can hide easily, your step are slowed, lake are frozen (so no hiding in them), etc..) and Naoe (assassin) and Yasuke (samurai) feel completely different and impose new playstyles. 

Mids: Combat is good but is a bit repetitive (mainly because there's not many enemy types), skills are nice and useful for the most part but once you find 2 or 3 that you like you will stick with those, same for weapons. If you play to find everything exploration feels a bit repetitive when it comes to temples and side activities, dialogues are a bit meh and choices dont really matter except when it comes to sidekicks. Performances were bad on launch (pc) but within a month they fixed it (you still need a pretty good computer to run the game at ultra 1080p).

Cons: Story is way to complicated for nothing; they introduce so many side characters and try interlinking them but at the end only like 4 characters are really important. It's the same problem as the other one before: '' Oh no they killed someone I care about'' or '' Oh no they want to take over the territory''. It's basic and the story is only driven by vengeance for both Naoe and Yasuke. On a another note; Yasuke's side of the story is REALLY interesting compare to Naoe, which is a shame. It doesn't feel like they gave the same amount of love to the 2 characters (maybe because they knew Naoe was gonna be more popular so they wanted to emphasise more on Yasuke idk). 

Personal note: this game felt amazing to play and captured the ambience of japan incredibly. I probably spent at least 5 hours total in photo mode. This is the type of game that wins me over, disabling the HUD and walking slowly with your horse through fields or forest while your sound is at 100%; nothing gave me this feeling since Got or Rdr2 beside this game.

Unfortunately, as with almost every new Assassin’s Creed release, some features I grew attached to in previous entries are missing here. It’s frustrating to see mechanics constantly swapped out instead of carried forward. For once, I’d like Ubisoft to keep the systems we’ve grown used to and simply build on them by adding new layers, rather than reinventing the wheel each time.

76561198042497186,"Assassin's Creed Shadows is an absolutely incredible game that gets an easy recommendation from me but that being said I do think this game will only appeal to two types of people, those who like assassin's creed and those that like ninjas. As someone who loves both I was super hyped for this game but it did take some time for me to get into it due to a few issues, however now that I'm done I think this might be the best assassin's creed game, at least when you play as Naoe.

For starters let's go over the usual preamble, this is a modern ass creed rpg game that has all the normal trimmings. If you don't like ubislop, open world question mark collectathons with forced ubisoft launcher always online DRM then just don't even bother. This is a ubi game through and through and you've already decided before playing if this game is worth your time or not. 

Right let's talk about the game, AC shadows is the next instalment in the long running franchise that sees use take on the role of dual protagonists Naoe and Yasuke and set in this generations favourite location, feudal Japan. I've been dying for an assassin's creed game set in Japan since I first played assassin's creed 1 on my dad's ps3 and yes ghost of tsushima has beaten it the to punch (and that game has a much better story and visual style.) Ac shadows still stands tall as an excellent ninja sandbox with the best controlling assassin the franchise has ever seen.

Let's talk gameplay, things have been trimmed back to make for a more tighter experience so no boating, no bird, only two armour slots, only 3 weapon types per character (ok yaskue actually has five but two are ranged) and no gender swap on the fly. Initially I felt a bit of disappointment as I appreciated how flexible valhalla was (want two shields? Sure why not.) That said the focus on a tigher gameplay experience really does pay off with incredible stealth, impactfull combat and a beautiful world. 

The main gimmick this time is that we have two protagonists that we can swap between similar to syndicate. You have Naoe as the assassin who's focus is on stealth gameplay and parkour, then we have Yasuke who's basically just for combat. Here is my issue, Yasuke is a really cool and interesting character and I really enjoyed his presence in the story and he really is the star of the show but his gameplay just doesn't appeal to me, we had a whole game focused more on combat than stealth with valhalla so I really didn't even feel like playing as him, not to say he feels bad to play as his melee combat is incredibly satisfying and I do enjoy it when I play as him but out in the open world he is slow and heavy and lacks the mobility the other protagonist has. Naoe on the other hand is the opposite, whilst no slouch in combat her gameplay excels in stealth and parkour , her animations are beautiful, her move set varied and her character arc is fantastic, truly one of my favourite characters in all of AC history. 

Story is whatever unfortunately. As with most of these AC games the real life history is fantastic and interesting with the real historical figures stealing the spotlight, the main characters are really great and I also like the modern stuff despite it being really bad in this game. However like all previous ac rpg games the story is too disorganised and unfocused with so many pointless side characters that any semblance of a compelling plot is lost by how disjointed it all is. Also the voice acting is pretty poor. 

Music is fantastic, I had my reservations as Jesper Kyd did such a fantastic job with valhalla that I was worried this game wouldn't stand a chance, thankfully after sometime I did come to really love this games soundtrack especially the mixing of traditional Japanese instruments with a more modern score. 

Just to summarise this review, as I always say with any ninja game, I really like ninjas, like a lot. From tenchu to shinobi I've always loved them and this is a fantastic ninja simulator, if you're the kind of person who says stuff like ac4 is a great pirate game or valhalla a good viking game then let me say this is both a fantastic ninja game and probably my favourite assassin's creed yet.

76561199838372842,"

This is the AC that restores faith in Ubisoft capabilities in making over-milked franchise still a delightful game to play. The last AC to give me this excitement and thrill was AC Black Flags. The amount of shock-innovations and new mechanics in the game, is just amazing.

Although, I was skeptical as to WTF is a black man doing as a samurai in Japan (and giggled the same way when they made tom cruise the last samurai: giggle full of despise), and as one of the MAIN protagonist. I stand corrected. There is historical background to back it up, and it fits to the lore perfectly. 

The Graphics 9/10:
- Wind Mechanics. This is amazing! The wind mechanics moves gracefully with all the vegetations, fabrics, and hair in the game. They are not stingy about it too! plenty of winds, plenty of movements, and it compliments the atmosphere of the lore and movements of the characters well. It moves well with every strike movements you make, every tedious travel distance between map points is now bearable due to the breathtaking views and environment. 

- The environment is delightful. It really sucks you in the medieval Japan era as you would've imagined it would be. NPCs are much much much more lively than what cyberpunk promised it would be on their game: you can see people playing Biwas, with kids and cats watching. Speaking of cats, which you can keep as a pet for your stronghold one day, including most dogs and animals you see.  The shopkeepers, the fishermen, the temples, everything is top of the line even in 2025. 

- Depending on your rig, on max settings, character details are amazing, although not as great as modded skyrim character details, but combined with the wind physics and smooth, realistic body movements, its great to spend hundreds of hours on (as ur character is always in the middle of the screen the whole time). The hair of the characters responds greatly to raytracing, as you can see the shines on the hairstrands, combined with the wind physics, is a sight for sore eyes. Blood and gore is plenty, and enough to satisfy people who bought AC. Too much blood and gore? go play candy crush or harvest moon instead. You're in the wrong game. Also, blood, mud, liquid, sticks and change to how your character's face and clothes looks. Costume design is amazing, as always from AC franchises. You can really see the difference between good and cheap silk or cotton. Great wooden armour and great metal armours, its all visible and makes a great difference in your choice of which items to wear or show appearances as. 

- relatable cutscenes. ALL cutscenes will follow what your character wears on that time (unless headgear which is hidden at all cutscenes, understandable as most headgears covers their facial expressions, and most players will prefer to see the full bare face instead of wearing headgears instead.)

- Audio, BGM, Voiceover. YOU MUST PLAY IN IMMERSIVE MODE. Playing it on english voiceover is nasty. Its like watching half-baked swedish stand up comedian trying to do a japanese accent. I don't see why its required that they attempt the voiceovers to do accents, since they already have immersive mode. You don't see Ezio saying ITSA MEEE... MMMMMARIOO. Follow the suggestion, turn immersive mode on, and rely on subtitiles instead. Naoe's voice is very annoying in english, and certain part of the stories is much much more relatable if in Japanese [spoiler] (such as Yasuke's japanese accent slowly getting more authentic as you progress in game-time), especially on his journey as a student to nobunaga's bushido teacher[/spoiler]

In summary : The graphics and environment itself is already worth the pricetag. This made photo-mode more fun, and actually an activity you would take part in. I have no complains about the graphics, however on lower end graphic cards, they can actually allocate more processing power to the main character's facial details and sacrifice a bit of the environment. As when I tried the game on my other computer, the character's face looks a bit cartoonish in contrast to the very very detailed environment even though I have already adjusted the graphic settings. 

Second complaint is monotonic appearances. As issues with most open-world games, too much similar looking NPCs spawn. hairstyles are too little in variety, the clothes they wear too. Its like the same NPC again and again as you travel. It also effects when you see that certain important characters like Naoe's father looks similar to several other NPCs and characters in the game, even though he is a big part of the story. 

Gameplay

Oh wow, just wow. The Hideout features is amazing. You can build and customize your own hideout, where we would specifically gather resources and travel to find the blueprints everywhere just to make our hideout looks better. Lustrous Japanese gardens as you see in anime and movies? yup, you can make it your own now. 

However most items and buildings you put in the hideout is useless and non-interactable, You can build a tea room but you can make people or event for people to have tea in it, and the further from the vanilla main hideout building, the less NPCs you will see in the hideout. 

I wanted to criticize the non-switchable Day-Night feature in the game, but as Ubisoft said its going to be patched in next. 

Combat is great, you can choose to use a brute slash and dash character like how you'd play dynasty warrior games, or to classic AC style character anytime in the game (as long as you are not in certain storyline situations or in combat or in no-trespassing zone). Basically anywhere u can fast travel, u can quickly switch characters. 

The new combat abilities given to Naoe is also great, as now its difficult to only rely on your assassination skills, at certain parts of the game, Naoe can combat well too given you grind thru the game enough. 

The Grind:
If you're the kind to like to finish sidequests first as I do, there is not much grind in the game. Just finish the major sidequests and you'll be above average in the gameplay challenge, as in it wouldnt be hard for you to complete the game. 

The Open World:
I really think, after seeing the game datas, this will be expanded to reallllly huge just like AC odessey, The map just uncovers states surrounding Kyoto. And this is already really troublesome to explore every spot of the map, especially on the edges of the map where travel guidelines will begin to have errors and leading u to places you can't proceed to waypoint easily and needs to do the side-climbing mountains like you do in skyrim. Maybe its because they lock the regions of the maps in the edges for the DLCs to come.

I really think it will be much much much bigger, especially since this is based on sengoku jidai era, [spoiler] the ending barely covers the middle of sengoku jidai where there is so mucb more room for DLCs which im exited for, as which they already announced new regions and chapter in the story is coming on the next DLC this mid september. Imagine, it can go on to the end of sengoku jidai, the reunification of Japan under Tokugawa and Toyotomi Hideyoshi[/spoiler]

To close:

Great game, worth every penny, despite what the negative comments say, the best AC ubisoft has ever made.

Great graphics, and a balanced combat/stealth system that isn't too difficult or too easy. 

Contender for the worst story and writing of the AC series, extremely predictable and a complete waste of potential. Game is still full of bugs several months later, i.e. heavy attack on KBM doesn't work and requires re-mapping (https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/shadows/bug-reporter/issues/ACSH-1709), Yasuke Samurai ability reset after teleport, and the DX12 crash that randomly happens requiring you to re-compile shaders. Also, I have a few hundred hours into AC Brotherhood and AC Odyssey, why does the movement feel more and more clunky, e.g. following diagonal roof tiles unintentionally during stealth, Yasuke can't reach anything and in general you can't climb and slide off of too many things in this mountainous region. The list goes on and on.

This really could have been an amazing game, and put all of the criticism and drama in its place. But the enshittification of Assassin's Creed is the strongest impression I get from this game and I am probably not going to play any more AC games after this one.

76561199485770842,"10/10 – The Assassin’s Creed We’ve Been Waiting For

Assassin’s Creed Shadows is everything I hoped it would be and more. From the moment the game starts, it pulls you into a breathtaking vision of feudal Japan. The world is alive—villages bustle with activity, forests feel dangerous and mysterious, and every rooftop is an opportunity for stealth.

Combat feels fluid and weighty. Switching between the samurai’s brutal precision and the shinobi’s shadowy finesse creates endless gameplay variety. Stealth is finally back at the heart of the series, with tools and mechanics that reward patience, creativity, and timing. At the same time, the open fights are cinematic and satisfying, making you feel like you’re living out a Kurosawa film.

The story is gripping, grounded in Japanese history while weaving in the rich Assassin’s Creed lore we know and love. The characters are memorable, the choices feel meaningful, and the atmosphere is unmatched.

Visually, the game is stunning—sunsets over temples, rain-slick rooftops, snow falling on battlefields. Every frame could be a screenshot-worthy moment. The soundtrack ties it all together with a mix of tense stealth pieces and sweeping, emotional scores.

Ubisoft has finally struck the perfect balance between classic Assassin’s Creed gameplay and modern RPG depth. This is the pinnacle of the series, and one of the best open-world experiences I’ve ever played.

If you’re a fan of Assassin’s Creed, samurai, or just incredible video games in general, this is an absolute must-play.

76561198103063931,"The game is perfectly fine. Which, admittedly, is quiete underwhelming given its price. 
I wanted this game to be amazing but ...

The start: 
The beginning of this game was promising. The story setup is nothing groundbreaking but the presentation was pretty great. When you first lay eyes on the villains, I thought they looked really cool. But then the actual game starts and you are met with all the frustrating features, or lack thereof. 

In previous AC games you had the option to meditate to change the time of day. For some reason this got removed for the game that has the greatest emphasis on day/night dynamics in the series yet. This point alone is just such a big annoyance. There are a handful of missions you can only do at certain daytimes, so you are forced to just wait around or occupy you with different things in the meantime. I'm harping on about something that might not be a big deal for some, but my point is, that this is ubisoft removing a feature for no reason, other than to ""trap"" you in the game longer.

The middle:
This was the roughest part of the game for me. When I think back on Odyssey where Kassandra was both a great fighter AND assassin, then shadows just pales in comparisson. Switching characters is annoying. Especially since both need there gear and skillpoints to be maintaned. Inventorymanagment every 5 minutes because you found some new bow or something is just tiring. 

The story also takes a big dive once you get to all the mini-storys about hunting the shinbakufu. This little arks are written as if the present major plot, but none of the emotions they wand to evoke within them come across, because they are not given nearly enough time. What do I care that character x has died, betrayed me, lives happily ever after, if I only ever saw them for one cutscene in which they mostly talked exposition at me?

The end:
At some point though I resigned myself to just play the game and stop the negative thoughts that plagued my mind. It's frustrating gamedesign and mediocre story story aside ... The game still has a few positives. When the gameplay starts to flow, it is very enjoyable.

Even then, stealth doesn’t work properly: some enemies can’t be killed with the hidden blade, and after a strike you often have to fight for a long time, which becomes boring.

Yasume is supposed to be a great samurai, but he doesn’t feel like one -more like a big Hulk who just smashes everything.

76561198057975641,"I can see why some people hate on this game (and Ubisoft), but I think it is mostly unwarranted. I am about half way through this game, I am taking my time, and it is really enjoyable. If you like Assassin's Creed, stealth, RPG, then this game does it really well. [b]Overall I'd give it an 8/10.[/b] 

Full disclosure, I am playing on a Steam Deck. The performance is ok, I get 30 FPS with everything turned down, so it runs well, but it doesn't do the games visuals justice, nor can I speak to that. It absolutely kills the battery on the Deck though, I get about 1 hour - 1 hour and a half, max. Make sure you are near a charger.

[h1]Theme and Story[/h1]
The theme and the story to the game are typical Assassin's Creed, I think people (including myself) have waited a long time to be able to play a ninja in Assassin's Creed and for it to be set in Japan, and now we can! It is set in Feudal Japan, around 1579, and the story and the Codex (the internal wiki/help/guide/history book for the game) do a good job of setting the scene for the time period, and there is a lot of depth there. I have found myself reading into this time in history more, and it has made my exploration and experience in the game much more enjoyable.
Some people have said the prologue is too long, and that it is a lot of cut scenes, that can be frustrating if you just want to get on and murder some Samurais, but I quite enjoyed it. It gave me a good frame of reference for the game and setting.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
As for the gameplay, you can tell Ubisoft have put a lot into the combat and RPG elements, and that is honestly what has me enjoying this game for this long, because it is repeatable. It is so satisfying playing as Naoe to sneak around and eliminate guards one by one using all sorts of tactics and tools. Of all of the Assassin's Creed games (I have played most of them since AC1) this is the best combat system by far. But if you don't want to be stealthy and just want to run in swinging then Yasuke is also really fun, he has different weapons (so does Naoe) that give a whole different style of combat. The only downside here is the amount of animations are lacking, but there is still a good enough variety to make it interesting, but not too many that it is unpredictable in the moves you are going to execute.

[h1]Map and Exploration[/h1]
The map size, variety, and features are also really impressive, I am 100 hours in and I am just getting to the 6th zone out of 9. Yes, I have been taking my time and trying to explore as much as I can, and when I go back to an area that I have been to before it is not familiar and played out, it still feels quite fresh and new to explore. And it is not just an empty map, there are cities (like Osaka and Kyoto) and towns where a lot of the main quests are, but then there are smaller places out in the mountains and woods that you can and sometimes need to go to complete quests. The downsides here are the buildings can be mostly the same, it can feel a bit played out after climbing up and trying to find the grapple point for the same asset (building) for the 100th time. And one thing that confuses me is if you go to a viewpoint to uncover the fog of war on the map it doesn't. The viewpoints are more so to explore the environment with your character it seems, as well as fast travel points.

[h1]RPG and Gear[/h1]
The RPG elements and progression are nice, new weapons/armour, weapon/armour upgrades, mastery trees, it gives load of room for playing how you want to play. You can modify the look of the weapons once you have the weapon/armour, and you can even change the blade, grip, sheath, etc. Learning the mastery tree and the weapons and what works well together has taken me some time, and I am still learning it. And you can change it to however you want to suit your playstyle. There are engravings too to add further effects to your gear. That said the downsides here are I found I got my best in slot (BiS) weapons and armour quite quick once I figured out what worked for me, and getting legendaries aren't that hard or challenging, meaning the epics and uncommons don't really have a place once you get your BiS, you just upgrade your legendaries to your level in the forge and you are good. The other downside would be there is not that many cosmetic options, I have about 5-10 for each weapon, and I am not picking up new styles, just ones I have already got before.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
The difficulty settings are really nice, you can change the combat and stealth difficulties independently, for example I am playing on nightmare stealth and expert combat (it goes Story, Forgiving, Normal, Expert, Nightmare). This allow you to play exactly what works for you, and with the higher difficulties you have to make sure that you pay attention, practice combat a bit more, and make sure your equipment is upgraded regularly to be competitive (meaning more side quests/exploring). 

[h1]Downsides[/h1]
Now onto some of the other downsides I haven't mentioned in there respective sections. The always online play, whilst this has only been an issue for me once, is a no bueno. Its a single player game! You shouldn't need to be always online connected to Ubisoft to enjoy this game.
Sometimes the controls can be a pain and not fully intuitive, like you want to jump out of a window when a guard is chasing you, and you climb up the damn wall!
The only other thing to mention would be the lack of variety in places, like I mentioned above.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
This is one of the few games where I have actually really enjoyed exploring, looking around, seeing what challenge or treasure is around the next corner. I am enjoying levelling up, always improving on the extensive mastery tree, being more deadly and trying out new ways of infiltrating and assassinating.

This is such a weird product, and an even weirder Assassin’s Creed game. It does so many things right, yet some other aspects are absolutely horrendous.

Visuals – The most beautiful open world I’ve ever seen. The vegetation is unlike anything I’ve seen before, even compared to UE5 titles. But then you look at the faces, both in terms of details and animation, and it feels like a Skibidi Toilet Garry’s Mod movie maker project.

Story – Incredibly awful. Not just the worst story in the AC series, but maybe in gaming as a whole. The narrative structure is abysmal,  it’s actually offensive. It could’ve just been a basic revenge tale, a C-tier story with nothing special behind it. But Ubisoft somehow managed to butcher even that, turning it into a masterclass in how to ruin the simplest plot imaginable. Honestly, it’s impressive how badly they screwed this up.

Gameplay – Probably the best gameplay AC has ever had. Parkour is still less deep than in older titles, but this time it’s not worse,  just different, and I’m fine with that. It looks good and feels good, unlike Origins or Odyssey.
Naoe’s combat is actually great,  it reminds me a lot of Unity, which I think had the best combat style in the series. Stealth as Naoe on hard mode is incredible, genuinely challenging, with the best enemy AI AC has ever seen.

Yasuke’s gameplay, on the other hand, is just… meh. Pretty much just a brainless button-mash.

And that’s the paradox here. Naoe’s gameplay is good, like really good for AC. But her story? The worst thing to ever happen to this series. Even killing the main villain off in a comic book wasn’t as insulting as this. Meanwhile, Yasuke’s story (especially the flashbacks) had some genuinely good moments and an interesting concept for AC… but his gameplay is painfully boring.

It feels like two different studios made this game. The opening and the flashbacks (which feel more like an actual intro) seem like Ubi Montreal’s work. You can see the potential, even a slight flirt with a Tarantino vibe. But then Ubi Quebec comes in, chops the story into pieces, sprinkles them around as “flashbacks,” and slaps on their classic “funny” tone that kills any seriousness.

I almost wanted to recommend this game despite the atrocious story… until one moment completely broke me. To recruit a side character, you’re forced to trek across Japan while they keep saying things like, “Let’s not talk here, I know a better place.” Disgusting design. Imagine going on a date in London, and at the end she says, “Next time, let’s meet at my favorite spot.” Then the next day she sends you a Snap from some random Siberian village saying, “Waiting for you, XO.” That’s the level of nonsense Ubisoft pulled here.

Get it on the sale if you want a beautiful Japan vibe and a gorgeous game from the tech perspective.",False,11,1,0.569000661373138428,0,1756266523,1756266523

How did they ruin it? Yasuke. We now have 2 protagonists, Yasuke being the second. He is a big, clumsy, beefy tank who cannot do any of the things Naoe can. In 40 yrs gaming I have never played this type of character and there has never been one in a AC game before.

76561198074371820,"I very rarely thumbs down a game. I'm not the type of person to just pick up and try a bunch of different games and I don't buy many games on release before I can do extensive research and hear what my favorite reviewers have to say.

But I just can't recommend this game. It has some quality aspects, which I will mention below, but overall it suffers from many of the same fundamental problems as Valhalla. That means it's almost impossible to avoid getting bored of this game after about 20 hours.

I'll start with the good parts because it'll be short. I actually like Naoe as a protagonist with the Japanese voice actress. The world is incredibly beautiful visually and the performance is quite good and scalable. With a 5070ti and 5700X3D I was able to get 100 fps consistently with frame gen on but with everything maxed out (including ray tracing). 

In terms of gameplay, the only thing I really had fun with throughout the entire 60 hours was the improved stealth. With going prone and the shadows/visibility mechanic, they really deliver a decent shinobi/ninja fantasy. Naoe's animations are especially satisfying to execute, even if they get old after a while. I would suggest using the expert stealth difficulty because it's still not too difficult but forces more thoughtfulness about how you approach situations.

They set up a decent, if unoriginal, vengeance story within the first 10 hours. The problem is that the game totally blows the lead by opening up into a mostly nonlinear narrative progression that felt similarly tiring and discontinuous as Valhalla. This is probably the biggest issue with the game because once the gameplay starts to feel repetitive (as open world games almost always do after a certain point, even the good ones), you need a narrative hook to keep you progressing. Shadows just presents you with a million different short, contained, regional stories that don't give you enough time to even care about the characters. Once you finish one story, all the events and characters are instantly deleted from your memory because the narrative structure prevents them from impacting what comes next. There are a handful of ongoing characters (your ""allies"") but they are so disconnected from the larger narrative that they never felt worth pursuing.

Now this is a good time to talk about Yasuke and the dual protagonist system. Yasuke is fine enough as a character and his backstory was decently interesting, so the problem wasn't anything to do with ""wokeness"" or whatever else people are crying about. It's just that he feels horrible to play with compared to Naoe and the dual protagonist system waters everything down. I never volunteered to play with Yasuke and that is in large part because the combat in this game doesn't feel good. I played most of the game with expert combat difficulty to add more tension to the stealth, but I ended up lowering it back down to normal towards the end because there are more forced Yasuke missions and it felt like a slog on expert. Yasuke doesn't give you the proper samurai fantasy because they designed him as a giant, overpowering warrior. Comparing the combat to Ghost of Tsushima is night and day. GoT makes you feel slick: graceful but also brutal. And nothing demonstrates that clearer than boss battles, which are just clunky and unfun in Shadows but in GoT they could deliver proper atmospheric and fast-paced sword-fighting duels.

To top it off, they basically make assaulting castles with Yasuke a miserable experience because they have an alarm system that floods the area with these ""Guardian"" enemies that do little more than just make the whole thing take forever. It's always quicker and easier to infiltrate with Naoe. But even then, the level design is so repetitive that even though the locations are only different in a way that feels like a procedurally generated maps in an ARPG. The fact that so much of the game is large, open environments also means that both the parkour and shadows/visibility system weren't utilized as much as they could've been. This game, perhaps even more than the last few major RPG AC games, would have benefited greatly from denser city environments.

Speaking of the world, I said it was beautiful but there's literally almost nothing in it. All the locations feel the same and there's such limited interactivity in the environments that they generally just feel like backdrops as you ride from one assassination target to another. I get that they were trying to introduce some open world activities that would be more meditative, with the idea being that you improve your ""knowledge"" through these activities and that allows your character's skills to progress. But all these side activities are so shallow and lack any real gameplay to them, so it never achieves that desired effect.

In fact, all the RPG elements are lacking and I think this is another area where the dual protagonist system really hurt the game. Because you have to have an entire skill tree and item economy set up for Yasuke, Naoe's options felt limited. I really wish they would have stuck with only Naoe and devoted all the development time to her. Just think of all the effort spent developing animations, skills, dialogue, weapons, and armor for Yasuke instead of Naoe There's basically little choice in the RPG systems other than what weapon do you want to focus on and the combat was so tedious that I didn't really care to experiment too much anyways.

Another thing that removes the desire to explore and engage in the world is the terrible side quests. Nearly everything is just, ""here's a new list of assassination targets"". And really what else could there be? There's really no gameplay in Shadows other than stealth and combat, and because they let you choose between Naoe and Yasuke most of the time you know that the side quests can't really care that much about your character. 

I also hate the hideout. I think people always treat these systems as ""well I know some people will like this and there's no harm if I don't engage in it."" But again, they spent time and energy developing this system and all that it does is tie different progression systems to a singular location that you have to fast travel to all the time. For example, it would been better to have forges in the cities to at least give you something else to do there without having to fast travel back to the hideout just to upgrade your gear. Seriously, who thinks that in the game that lets you be a ninja what I really want to do is arrange buildings and decorate homes?

76561199166926086,"""This isn’t a perfect game or a groundbreaking one—but it’s one I connected with, and that made it worth every hour.""

After putting over 75 hours into Assassin's Creed Shadows, I can confidently say this game is worth experiencing—despite all the wrongs Ubisoft may have done in the past. It's definitely a grindy game, and like AC Odyssey, you’ll need to invest time to level up and farm your way through progression. But if you enjoy that type of gameplay loop, the reward is there.

The story is strong, and the characters are very well-written. Every main and side character feels like they have their own purpose, background, and growth. I was genuinely able to connect with many of them. Even after so many hours, I didn’t feel bored. Sure, there are repetitive moments—it has the same here-and-there vibes as past entries—but the beauty of the world pulled me in.

Roaming through feudal Japan is just stunning. The environment design, architecture, and attention to detail are areas where Ubisoft really shines. I often found myself just exploring for the sake of it.

Now, a few things to note:

Facial animations were a bit of a downside. At times, they lacked expression or felt off during emotional scenes.

Performance-wise, I had a smooth experience—no major stutters or glitches, just a few minor issues here and there, nothing game-breaking.

Gameplay and story remain the heart of the experience. That’s what kept me going, and it’s why I enjoyed it. The in-game weekly pass also caught my attention—you complete missions, earn keys, and exchange them for skins and weapons. No need to spend extra real money, which was a welcome surprise.

To wrap it up: Assassin's Creed Shadows isn’t a bold reinvention of the series, but it’s also not stuck in the past. It’s walking its own path. It may not be for everyone, and that’s okay. If you enjoy RPG-style Assassin’s Creed games with immersive worlds and deep characters, give this one a shot.

It has its pros and cons, but I enjoyed it. And in the end, that’s what matters.

76561199246413832,"After dedicating 200 hours to this game, I can confidently say it's well worth the time. The story is consistently engaging, especially with Yasuke and Naoe's individual arcs. The voice acting could use some polish, but it's far from terrible. Combat is fluid and requires strategic play, setting it apart from earlier titles. The parkour system is a notable upgrade, featuring new mechanics like prone movement and a grappling hook for environmental traversal. The weapons are unique, each offering distinct perks, abilities, and finishers. My main issue is Ubisoft's choice of a fog of war-style map, which complicates exploration in feudal Japan's complex terrains. Despite this, I'd give the game an 8 out of 10, mainly due to minor issues with voice acting and the map design. Overall, it's a well-made game, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for the Assassin's Creed series.",True,34,12,0.561437666416168213,0,1755747084,1755747084

Assuming you don't live under a rock you heard of that game so I'm just going to review the Linux experience, including Steam Deck.

On PC with an i7 8700 and a NVIDIA 3060 12 GB I was getting 30-50 fps on medium settings. Switching the GPU to a 4070XT I get 50-90 on high. I think that's very good with a CPU that many generations late as in my experience AC games always have been CPU intensive. Didn't have to play around with Proton versions or any setting. No glitch or crash after 40h.  I don't like FSR and the weird aura it draws around the main character but this game is clearly built for it. Except for that aura, the game looks better and FPS goes up by 20 on the 4070XT by using FSR even though it ""shouldn't"" be necessary.

On Steam Deck there is sometimes so audio crackling but that's it. I'm impressed. Default settings, it looks great and runs at 25-30 fps constantly. The latest AC runs fine on a portable. WTH.",True,0,0,0.5,0,1755192580,1755192580

When you’re traveling the world, the visuals are stunning. Unfortunately, the cutscenes, excluding the main story ones, look awful. The lighting is often off, and sometimes characters’ mouths don’t even move while they’re speaking. On a brighter note, the seasonal changes are impressive, offering the world in a variety of beautiful styles.

Story
The opening is decent, though it’s loaded with cutscenes. By the time you finally get to play, there’s little real guidance. You end up assassinating a string of targets, becoming overleveled, and when you return to the main story… well, it’s basically over. You get one final mission that actually feels like it’s building to something, but it’s the end.

Traversing the World
The world looks amazing, but whatever you do, stay on the paths. Stray too far, and you’ll find yourself wrestling your horse through dense bamboo forests and steep mountains. You’ll get stuck a lot... It makes you wonder: why make the world this huge if exploring it is such a chore?

Conclusion

76561198273202583,"If Assassin’s Creed games were mixtapes, Shadows would be that rare B-side track that hardcore fans banged on repeat, but with upgraded fidelity. After years of tiptoeing between RPG sprawl and stealth-lite showboating, Ubisoft has finally handed us a stealth-reflective anthem that delivers both nostalgia and modern polish.

Historical Reverie & Franchise Lineage
Set in late 1500s Sengoku-era Japan, during the Azuchi-Momoyama period, the game unfolds across Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, Iga, and more. The cast includes Nobunaga, Hattori Hanzo, Sen no Rikyū, Jesuit missionaries, and other historical figures.
Long-time AC fans have been waiting for Japan since the Ezio trilogy, and Shadows finally delivers. It intertwines Naoe’s vengeance-driven shinobi path with Yasuke’s samurai redemption arc — two contrasting journeys that fuel a story of honor, resistance, and loyalty in Ubisoft’s richest rendition of feudal Japan yet.

Gameplay Mechanics & Character Synergy
Stealth is finally back with weight. The ability to go prone, extinguish lanterns, and melt into real shadows injects a Splinter Cell energy into Assassin’s Creed’s DNA. The return of observation tools and Eagle Vision lets you tag enemies, loot, and patrol routes with satisfying precision.
Naoe plays like a blade of lightning — grappling hooks, smoke bombs, daggers, and fluid parkour make her a purist’s dream. Yasuke is the opposite: a powerhouse tank wielding katanas, naginata, and bows. He’s not an assassin by trade, but he’s a warrior who can clear a courtyard in seconds.

World, Seasons, and Atmosphere
The world feels alive in a way past AC games only hinted at. Seasons change the landscape and gameplay — frozen ponds in winter let you cross undetected, tall grass in spring gives you cover, icicles can betray your position.
Weather and lighting affect infiltration strategy. Dark forests and lantern-lit streets carry different risks depending on time of day. Hideout mechanics return with Brotherhood-style customization: recruiting allies, training scouts, and upgrading your base with both aesthetic and functional improvements.

Polishing & Technical Merit
Visually, it’s stunning. Forests sway in the wind, castle towns bustle with life, and temples feel like living monuments. Performance is solid on PC and next-gen consoles, with only minor bugs. Accessibility options are strong, though PC keybind customization still has a little room for improvement.

Downsides
Repetitive mission loops can creep in toward the late game, echoing the RPG fatigue of Odyssey and Valhalla. Yasuke’s story sometimes feels underdeveloped compared to Naoe’s. The educational Discovery Tour mode is gone, replaced by a historical codex. Microtransactions exist, but they’re largely cosmetic.

Final Thoughts & Legacy Potential
As a series die-hard, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the cocktail I’ve wanted for years: sleek stealth, dual-protagonist variety, environmental depth, historical richness, and a world that rewards exploration instead of checklist grinding. It revitalizes the series with enough polish and focus to set a new standard for what AC can be.
If you care about true stealth gameplay, breathing historical worlds, and a game that respects its roots while moving forward, this one is worth every hour.

Score: 9/10 — A shadow among giants, and easily the best in the series since Brotherhood.. Fight me.

That's about the only good thing I can say about this game. the story is incredibly forgettable and honestly it's the only Assassin's Creed game that I haven't bothered to finish fully. I killed all the main targets and finished Naoe's personal story and that was it because i just felt so burned out. The voice acting is rough, and comes across as just plain bad sometimes to the point where i switched to Immersive mode. Yasuke is also not too fun to play as at all, and also feels very tacked on gameplay wise. That being said, storywise he somehow manages to be much more interesting than Naoe. Gameplay wise, he's very good in combat but that's literally fucking it. I rarely ever used him unless the game forced me to for certain story segments, and it feels like the higher ups at Ubisoft shoehorned him in as a playable character just so that Shadows didn't have a solo female main character, because they've BEEN doing that since Syndicate.

Also according to another friend who HAS beaten the game, Act 3 is literally only setup for DLC, and left him confused when the credits started rolling.

Hear ye, hear me. As someone who has enjoyed this game and even the recent SW Outlaws and its dlc's, I might just be one of Ubisoft's last fans. I like the direction they've put the franchise back on with this one. I've been enjoying playing almost weekly since launch, doing the weekly animus quests. My friends make fun of me for being one of the only people still playing this game. But on to my point!

Now the reason I love Assassin's Creed is for that smooth, easy power fantasy gameplay they're known for (And this game's pretty to look at as well). If I wanted a real stealth game, I'd probably play Metal Gear or Hitman. In AC Mirage I loved playing with the infinite knife build where you could always pick up your knives off of dead bodies. And I was VERY happy that they continued that for this game at launch. But now for some reason with the recent update, they've taken that ability away for the most part and also lowered the one ability where you got tools back 50% of the time to 10%. This kind of soils my favorite build and I don't know why they'd feel like doing that in a single player power fantasy game. I also just play on normal difficulty btw. Now I can still go around murtaling guards and innocent servants but it's definitely taken my gameplay variability away.

But I tells ya what Ubisoft. You give me my KNIVES back, at least the ability to pick them up off of dead bodies every time, and I'll give you a positive review. I'm a man of my word. U Capit?",False,0,1,0.474478781223297119,0,1755023382,1755023382

Assassin's Creed Shadows is an excellent addition to the sword slashing and shinobi genre of feudal Japan games. I think that for those who played Ghost of Tsushima, it will be hard to beat. While I'm not too sure if this game has, I think they're both on the same level but for different reasons. 

I'm seriously impressed with AC Shadows. The characters, environment and combat are all lovely. I think this game does an excellent job with it's story. I also love how cinematic the cut scenes are. 

I also love that you can create a hideout, I've always loved the idea of creating a secret base with allies!

76561198071739784,"I just wrapped up Assassin’s Creed Shadows after an intense 91 hours over 7 days and wow, what an unforgettable experience! Ubisoft has once again proven why they’re masters of crafting immersive worlds. The graphics are absolutely stunning, with breathtaking landscapes, intricate character designs, and a richness of detail that constantly pulled me in.

It’s a very big game and here’s the wild part: I only completed around 40% of the side missions. I mainly focused on the main story, but I’m absolutely going back to finish the rest. The world is incredible, filled with lush green fields, dense forests, snowy mountain paths, tranquil ponds, roaring waterfalls, vast oceans, temples, and more. The level of detail in Shadows is seriously impressive trees sway realistically in the wind, water ripples beautifully, and the lighting transforms each location into a work of art.

One of my favorite touches is how alive the world feels. Naoe and Yasuke can both get realistically dirty—blood and dust after combat, or mud if you dive right in. Take down an enemy in close combat, and you might find yourself stained in red. These little immersive details, combined with real-world locations and historical figures you can interact with, make the experience feel truly alive. More games should take this level of care in their design.

If I had to point out one disappointment, it’s that Yasuke doesn’t have eagle vision, can’t climb as freely as Naoe, and doesn’t get a hidden blade. Still, the overall experience more than makes up for it.

I’ve always loved the Assassin’s Creed series, but Shadows easily stands above the rest for me.

+This game's world is FLAT-OUT GORGEOUS. Wind effects are the best I've ever seen, and it's draw distance is really impressive. The vegetation in some spots is SO DENSE that it's actually recommended to stay on the roads sometimes - I actually consider that a positive.
+The map doesn't have icon burnout - a complaint from older games. If you wish, you can ""find your own fun"" and turn off ""Pathfinder"" mode.
+ There is a dub language mode that exclusively uses the local language. If a character most likely spoke Japanese in real life, then that's how they speak. Same for Portuguese, English, and so on.
+/- There is a ""Canon"" mode that follows what the devs consider the ""canonical"" choices/events. I personally like having this option on, but you may not like all the choices. YMMV.
-Sometimes, there are DX12 crashes on startup. No biggie, just boot it up again.
-Wish more mo-cap was used during cutscenes, characters are very robotic/rigid most of the time.
-Speaking of, all cutscenes are locked at.....31fps. Not 30 - it's 31. Not good.

-*Big issue*: most of the time, the game is stutter-free (other than rare traversal stutter, not a biggie). But then, frametimes will suddenly go off the rails and consistently stutter, no matter what settings. This starts even if I don't make any graphics tweaks - just tabbing out to a web browser. Sometimes, changing a setting will require a reload/restart; other times, that same setting won't do that at all - and stutter remains. This won't go away until I force the game to change it's graphics settings and restart the game - perhaps it needs a shader recalc? This has happened to me about a half-dozen times. Next time it happens, I might try to force a shader recalc.

-I wish the game's narrative design was a bit more strict. A bit of a ""Breath-of-the-Wild-itis"" situation. In giving you freedom to explore, it made some narrative concessions that are a bit hard to follow if you spend 20h in between story beats.

I'm probably about halfway through this game and the gameplay loop is already far too repetitive. Valhalla definitely felt that way towards the end, but at least taking the longship and doing raids felt dynamic. Here, fighting the Samurai Daisho at each Castle and fighting these tanky armored enemies just feels like a chore. The dual character system sounds good on paper, but in practice? It sucks. Naoe provides the real ""Assassin's Creed"" experience, but against armored opponents, the fights drag on and on. Yasuke is obviously better for dealing with armored opponents, but is not an assassin. His parkour skills are mediocre. What you get is an anachronistic story with the worst of both worlds. This is probably the only Assassin's Creed game where the developers were like, ""Okay, you can have stealth and parkour or you can be strong. Pick one."" Yeah. No.

The game is gorgeous and the gameplay (aside from having to switch between two characters, where one is stealth and the other just isn't an assassin and is probably the clumsiest protagonist in the franchise, is decent overall. The hideout mechanic is interesting, but more resources should have been spent making the game world feel more dynamic. The whole thing is basically a forest.
